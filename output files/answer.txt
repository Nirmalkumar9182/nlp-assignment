<p>An explicit cast to double isn't necessary.</p>

<pre><code>double trans = (double)trackBar1.Value / 5000.0;
</code></pre>

<p>Identifying the constant as <code>5000.0</code> (or as <code>5000d</code>) is sufficient:</p>

<pre><code>double trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000.0;
double trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000d;
</code></pre>

<p>Well, here's how we do it on Stack Overflow.</p>

<pre class="lang-csharp prettyprint-override"><code>var ts = new TimeSpan(DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks - dt.Ticks);

}
if (delta &lt; 120)
{
  return "a minute ago";
}
if (delta &lt; 2700) // 45 * 60

  return ts.Minutes + " minutes ago";

<p>Many years ago, to provide an <a href="http://cloud9.hedgee.com/age">age calculator gimmick</a> on my website, I wrote a function to calculate age to a fraction. This is a quick port of that function to C# (from <a href="http://hedgee.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/hedgee/trunk/chris/ckwww/ckage.php3">the PHP version</a>). I'm afraid I haven't been able to test the C# version, but hope you enjoy all the same!</p>

<p>(Admittedly this is a bit gimmicky for the purposes of showing user profiles on Stack Overflow, but maybe readers will find some use for it. :-))</p>

<pre><code>double AgeDiff(DateTime date1, DateTime date2) {<br>    double years = date2.Year - date1.Year;<br><br>    /*<br>     * If date2 and date1 + round(date2 - date1) are on different sides<br>     * of 29 February, then our partial year is considered to have 366<br>     * days total, otherwise it's 365. Note that 59 is the day number<br>     * of 29 Feb.<br>     */<br>    double fraction = 365<br>            + (DateTime.IsLeapYear(date2.Year) &amp;&amp; date2.DayOfYear &gt;= 59<br>            &amp;&amp; (date1.DayOfYear &lt; 59 || date1.DayOfYear &gt; date2.DayOfYear)<br>            ? 1 : 0);<br><br>    /*<br>     * The only really nontrivial case is if date1 is in a leap year,<br>     * and date2 is not.

<p>The best way that I know of because of leap years and everything is:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime birthDate = new DateTime(2000,3,1);<br>int age = (int)Math.Floor((DateTime.Now - birthDate).TotalDays / 365.25D);<br></code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>The answer by phpguy is correct but I think there is a lot of confusion in the  additional details there.</p>

<p>The basic answer is in a <code>BLOB</code> data type / attribute domain. <strong>BLOB</strong> is short for Binary Large Object and that column data type is specific for handling binary data.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/blob.html">the relevant manual page for MySQL</a>.</p>

<p>@jeff</p>

<p>IMHO yours seems a little long.  However it does seem a little more robust with support for "yesterday" and "years".  But in my experience when this is used the person is most likely to view the content in the first 30 days.  It is only the really hardcore people that come after that.  So that is why I usually elect to keep this short and simple.</p>

<p>This is the method I am currently using on one of my websites.  This only returns a relative day, hour, time.  And then the user has to slap on "ago" in the output.</p>

<pre><code>public static string ToLongString(this TimeSpan time)<br>{<br>    string output = String.Empty;<br><br>    if (time.Days &gt; 0)<br>        output += time.Days + " days ";<br><br>    if ((time.Days == 0 || time.Days == 1) &amp;&amp; time.Hours &gt; 0)<br>        output += time.Hours + " hr ";<br><br>    if (time.Days == 0 &amp;&amp; time.Minutes &gt; 0)<br>        output += time.Minutes + " min ";<br><br>    if (output.Length == 0)<br>        output += time.Seconds + " sec";<br><br>    return output.Trim();<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>There are no HTTP headers that will report the clients timezone so far although it has been suggested to include it in the HTTP specification.</p>

<p>If it was me, I would probably try to fetch the timezone using clientside JavaScript and then submit it to the server using Ajax or something.</p>
<p>I've had no trouble using the BSD sockets API in C++, in GNU/Linux. Here's the sample program I used:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br><br>int<br>main()<br>{<br>    return AF_INET;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>So my take on this is that z/OS is probably the complicating factor here, however, because I've never used z/OS before, much less programmed in it, I can't say this definitively. :-P</p>
<p>The parent <code>div</code> needs to have a defined <code>width</code>, either in pixels or as a percentage. In Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;7, the parent <code>div</code> needs a defined <code>width</code> for child percentage <code>div</code>s to work correctly.</p>

<p><code>Math.Floor</code> rounds down, <code>Math.Ceiling</code> rounds up, and <code>Math.Truncate</code> rounds towards zero. Thus, <code>Math.Truncate</code> is like <code>Math.Floor</code> for positive numbers, and like <code>Math.Ceiling</code> for negative numbers. Here's the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.truncate.aspx">reference</a>.</p>

<p>For completeness, <code>Math.Round</code> rounds to the nearest integer. If the number is exactly midway between two integers, then it rounds towards the even one. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.round.aspx">Reference.</a></p>

<p>See also: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14/whats-the-difference-between-math-floor-and-math-truncate-in-c/580252#580252">Pax Diablo's answer</a>. Highly recommended!</p>

<p>Sure I can post a test app.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br><br>int main()<br>{<br>    return AF_INET;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Compile/Link Output:</p>

<p>cxx -Wc,xplink -Wl,xplink -o inet_test inet.C</p>

<p>"./inet.C", line 5.16: CCN5274 (S) The name lookup for "AF_INET" did not find a declaration.</p>

<p>CCN0797(I) Compilation failed for file ./inet.C. Object file not created.</p>

<p>A check of sys/sockets.h does include the definition I need, and as far as I can tell, it is not being blocked by any #ifdef statements.</p>

<p>I have however noticed it contains a the following:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef __cplusplus<br>  extern "C" {<br>#endif<br></code></pre>

<p>which encapsulates basically the whole file. Not sure if it matters.</p>
<p>Consider using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.manualresetevent.aspx">ManualResetEvent</a> to block the main thread at the end of its processing, and call <code>Reset()</code> on it once the timer's processing has finished.  If this is something that needs to run constantly, consider moving this into a service process instead of a console app.</p>

<p>You can use something like <code>Console.ReadLine()</code> to block the main thread, so other background threads (like timer threads) will still work. You may also use an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.autoresetevent.aspx">AutoResetEvent</a> to block the execution, then (when you need to) you can call Set() method on that AutoResetEvent object to release the main thread. Also ensure that your reference to Timer object doesn't go out of scope and garbage collected.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brokenbuild.com/blog/2006/08/15/mysql-triggers-how-do-you-abort-an-insert-update-or-delete-with-a-trigger/">Here is one hack</a> that may work. It isn't clean, but it looks like it might work:</p>

<p>Essentially, you just try to update a column that doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Why don't you want to use triggers.  They are a good thing if you use them correctly.  If you use them as a way to enforce referential integrity that is when they go from good to bad.  But if you use them for monitoring, they are not really considered taboo.</p>
<p>Have a look at this article</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2006/06/as3_resource_ma.html">http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2006/06/as3_resource_ma.html</a></p>

<p>IANA actionscript programmer, however the feeling I'm getting is that, because the garbage collector might not run when you want it to.</p>

<p>Hence
<a href="http://www.craftymind.com/2008/04/09/kick-starting-the-garbage-collector-in-actionscript-3-with-air/">http://www.craftymind.com/2008/04/09/kick-starting-the-garbage-collector-in-actionscript-3-with-air/</a></p>

<p>So I'd recommend trying out their collection code and see if it helps</p>

<pre><code>private var gcCount:int;<br>private function startGCCycle():void{<br>    gcCount = 0;<br>    addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doGC);<br>}<br>private function doGC(evt:Event):void{<br>    flash.system.System.gc();<br>    if(++gcCount &gt; 1){<br>        removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doGC);<br>        setTimeout(lastGC, 40);<br>    }<br>}<br>private function lastGC():void{<br>    flash.system.System.gc();<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>(I'm not positive about this, but...)</p>

<p>AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection. Which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collected languages (like C# and Java as well).</p>

<p>Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by <code>byteArray</code> or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where <code>byteArray</code> is declared.</p>

<p>You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing... if you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help it.</p>

<p>To force a GC, try (yes, twice):</p>

<pre><code>flash.system.System.gc();
flash.system.System.gc();
</code></pre>

<p>Give your submit buttons same name like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" name="submitButton" value="Previous Page" /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name="submitButton" value="Next Page" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the user presses enter and the <em>Request</em> goes to server, you can check the value for <code>submitButton</code> on your server-side code which contains a collection of form <code>name/value</code> pairs. For example in classic ASP:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>If Request.Form("submitButton") = "Previous Page" Then
    ' Code for Previous Page
ElseIf Request.Form("submitButton") = "Next Page" Then
    ' Code for Next Page
End If
</code></pre>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.chami.com/tips/internet/042599I.html">Using multiple submit buttons on a single form</a></p>

<p>Would it be possible for you to change the previous button type into a button like this:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="button" name="prev" value="Previous Page" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the Next button would be the default, plus you could also add the <code>default</code> attribute to it so that your browser will highlight it like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" name="next" value="Next Page" default /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Unfortunately when it comes to memory management in <em>Flash/actionscript</em> there isn't a whole lot you can do. ActionScript was designed to be easy to use (so they didn't want people to have to worry about memory management)</p>

<p>The following is a workaround, instead of creating a <code>ByteArray</code> variable try this.</p>

<pre><code>var byteObject:Object = new Object();

byteObject.byteArray = new ByteArray();

...

//Then when you are finished delete the variable from byteObject
delete byteObject.byteArray;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>byteArray</code> is a dynamic property of <code>byteObject</code>, you can free the memory that was allocated for it.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is that the Distinct
 operator does not grant that it will
 maintain the original order of
 values.</strong></p>

<p>So your query will need to work like this</p>

<pre><code>var names = (from DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows
             select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct().OrderBy( name =&gt; name );
</code></pre>

<p>It is very simple with the <code>Skip</code> and <code>Take</code> extension methods.</p>

            select i;

var paggedCollection = query.Skip(startIndex).Take(count);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a general description of a technique for calculating pi that I learnt in high school.</p>

<p>I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of "Monte-Carlo" methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that don't immediately appear to be deducible through random processes.</p>

<p>Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible)</p>

<p>Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact.</p>

<p>Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.</p>

<p>Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. </p>

<p>This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods.</p>

<p>@Jax: The <code>extern "C"</code> thing matters, very very much. If a header file doesn't have one, then (unless it's a C++-only header file), you would have to enclose your <code>#include</code> with it:</p>

<pre><code>extern "C" {<br>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br>// include other similarly non-compliant header files<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Basically, anytime where a C++ program wants to link to C-based facilities, the <code>extern "C"</code> is vital. In practical terms, it means that the names used in external references will not be mangled, like normal C++ names would. <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/mixing-c-and-cpp.html">Reference.</a></p>
<p>I believe the easiest way would be to follow Jeff's own advice and have a look around existing code. Try looking at Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and other well known PHP-based CMS's to see how their API hooks look and feel. This way you can even get ideas you may have not thought of previously to make things a little more rubust.</p>

<p>A more direct answer would be to write general files that they would "include_once" into their file that would provide the usability they would need. This would be broken up into categories and NOT provided in one MASSIVE "hooks.php" file. Be careful though, because what ends up happening is that files that they include end up having more and more dependencies and functionality improves. Try to keep API dependencies low. I.E fewer files for them to include.</p>
<p>You could use an Observer pattern.  A simple functional way to accomplish this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php<br><br>/** Plugin system **/<br><br>$listeners = array();<br><br>/* Create an entry point for plugins */<br>function hook(){<br>  global $listeners;<br><br>  $num_args = func_num_args();<br>  $args = func_get_args();<br><br>  if($num_args &lt; 2)<br>    trigger_error("Insufficient arguments", E_USER_ERROR);<br><br>  // Hook name should always be first argument<br>  $hook_name = array_shift($args);<br><br>  if(!isset($listeners[$hook_name]))<br>    return; // No plugins have registered this hook<br><br>  foreach($listeners[$hook_name] as $func){<br>    $args = $func($args); <br>  }<br><br>  return $args;<br>}<br><br>/* Attach a function to a hook */<br>function add_listener($hook, $function_name){<br>  global $listeners;<br><br>  $listeners[$hook][] = $function_name;<br>}<br><br><br>/////////////////////////<br><br>/** Sample Plugin **/<br>add_listener('a_b', 'my_plugin_func1');<br>add_listener('str', 'my_plugin_func2');<br><br>function my_plugin_func1($args){<br>  return array(4, 5);<br>}<br>function my_plugin_func2($args){<br>  return str_replace('sample', 'CRAZY', $args[0]);<br>}<br><br>/////////////////////////<br><br>/** Sample Application **/<br><br>$a = 1;<br>$b = 2;<br><br>list($a, $b) = hook('a_b', $a, $b);<br><br>$str  = "This is my sample application\n";<br>$str .= "$a + $b = ".($a+$b)."\n";<br>$str .= "$a * $b = ".($a*$b)."\n";<br><br>$str = hook('str', $str);<br><br>echo $str;<br><br>?&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>This is my CRAZY application<br>4 + 5 = 9<br>4 * 5 = 20<br></code></pre>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.</p>

<p>This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.</p>

<p>It sounds like <code>this.Opacity</code> is a double value, and the compiler doesn't like you trying to cram a decimal value into it.</p>

<p>I believe you have answered your own question...</p>

<p><code>System.totalMemory</code> gives you the total amount of memory being "used", not allocated. It is accurate that your application may only be using 20mb, but it has 5mb that is free for future allocations.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the Adobe docs would shed light on the way that it manages memory...</p>

<p>Have a DTS job (or a job that is started by a windows service) that runs at a given interval. Each time it is run, it gets information about the given table by using the system <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186778.aspx">INFORMATION_SCHEMA</a> tables, and records this data in the data repository. Compare the data returned regarding the structure of the table with the data returned the previous time. If it is different, then you know that the structure has changed.</p>

<p>Example query to return information regarding all of the columns in table ABC (ideally listing out just the columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA table that you want, instead of using <em>select *</em> like I do here):</p>

<pre><code>select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'ABC'
</code></pre>

<p>You would monitor different columns and INFORMATION_SCHEMA views depending on how exactly you define "changes to a table".</p>
<p>If you use a return type of <code>IEnumerable</code>, you can return your <strong>query</strong> variable directly.</p>

<p>A more generic answer for the generic question "Decimal vs Double?": <strong>Decimal</strong> for monetary calculations to preserve the precision, <strong>Double</strong> for scientific calculations that do not get affected by small differences. Since Double is a type which is native to the CPU (internal representation is stored in <em>base 2</em>), calculations made with Double perform better then Decimal (which is represented in <em>base 10</em> internally).</p>

<p>One framework I'm considering would be for a blogging platform. Since just about any possible view of data you would want would be sorted by date, I was thinking about this structure:</p>

<p>One directory per content node:</p>

<pre><code>./content/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/
</code></pre>

<p>Subdirectories of each node including  </p>

<pre><code>/tags  
/authors  
/comments  
</code></pre>

<p>As well as simple text files in the node directory for pre- and post-rendered content and the like.</p>

<p>This would allow a simple PHP <a href="http://us3.php.net/glob" rel="nofollow"><code>glob()</code></a> call (and probably a reversal of the result array) to query on just about anything within the content structure:</p>

<pre><code>glob("content/*/tags/funny");  
</code></pre>

<p>Would return paths including all articles tagged "funny".</p>

<p>I've had problems with JavaHL in Eclipse Ganymede, when it worked fine in Eclipse Europa.  I'm not sure how Aptana is different, but try either upgrading JavaHL or switching to the pure-java SVNKit implementation within the Subclipse config.</p>
<p><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a></p>

<p>A very good resource for source control in general. Not really TortoiseSVN specific, though.</p>
<p>From my experience, and from what I've read across the internet, the answer is "No," it is not guaranteed.  It depends on CPU speed, operating system, flavor of Linux, etc.</p>
<p>One way to store flat-file content would be to save literal arrays to php files.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>$data = array();

if( $_POST ) {
    $data = $_POST;

    $content = "&lt;?php\n";
    $content .= '$data=' . var_export($data, true) . "\n";
    $content .= "?&gt;";

    save_to_file($filename, $content);
}

// echo form
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe. But you have bigger problems. <code>gettimeofday()</code> can result in incorrect timings if there are processes on your system that change the timer (ie, ntpd). On a "normal" linux, though, I believe the resolution of <code>gettimeofday()</code> is 10us. It can jump forward and backward and time, consequently, based on the processes running on your system. This effectively makes the answer to your question no.</p>

<p>You should look into <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> for timing intervals. It suffers from several less issues due to things like multi-core systems and external clock settings.</p>

<p>Also, look into the <code>clock_getres()</code> function.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual resolution of gettimeofday() depends on the hardware architecture. Intel processors as well as SPARC machines offer high resolution timers that measure microseconds. Other hardware architectures fall back to the system’s timer, which is typically set to 100 Hz. In such cases, the time resolution will be less accurate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I obtained this answer from <a href="http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&amp;seqNum=272">High Resolution Time Measurement and Timers, Part I</a></p>
<p>That's true.  <code>serialize()</code> can be pretty useful for that as well.</p>

<p>I think the trick to coming up with a viable system is finding some way to index the data nodes without killing yourself with complexity.</p>

<p>Javascript is the easiest way to get the client's local time.  I would suggest using an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to send back the local time, and if that fails, fall back to the timezone detected based on their IP address.</p>

<p>As far as geolocation, I've used <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location">MaxMind GeoIP</a> on several projects and it works well, though I'm not sure if they provide timezone data.  It's a service you pay for and they provide monthly updates to your database.  They provide wrappers in several web languages.</p>

<p>I guess in a managed environment, a leak would be you keeping an unnecessary reference to a large chunk of memory around.   </p>
<p>I will concur with Bernard as to in .net what a mem leak would be.</p>

<p>You could profile your application to see its memory use, and determine that if its managing a lot of memory when it should not be you could say it has a leak.</p>

<p>In managed terms I will put my neck on the line to say it does go away once the process is killed/removed.</p>

<p>Unmanaged code is its own beast and if a leak exists within it, it will follow a standard mem. leak definition.</p>

<p>I have been using the 64Bit version of TortoiseSVN for ages and I have never had issues with it on Windows 64Bit or Vista 64Bit. I am currently not aware of any other similiar SVN clients that do work on Vista. Is it possible the problem could lie within the configuration of TortoiseSVN or even the installation of Vista? Is the problem occurring on Vista native or SP 1?</p>
<p>The best explanation I've seen is in Chapter 7 of the free <a href="http://codebetter.com/files/folders/codebetter_downloads/entry179694.aspx">Foundations of Programming ebook</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, in .NET a memory leak occurs when referenced objects are rooted and thus cannot be garbage collected. This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope.</p>

<p>You'll know that you have leaks when you start getting outofmemoryexceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (perfmon has nice memory counters). </p>

<p>Understanding .NET's memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work (again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the ebook). Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object A registered to an event on object B, then object A will stick around until object B disappears because B holds a reference to A. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. </p>

<p>Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_memory_profiler/index.htm">red-gate ants profile</a>, JetBrains dotMemory, <a href="http://memprofiler.com/">memprofiler</a> are really good choices, or you can use the text-only windbg and sos, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).</p>

<p>I believe unmanaged code is subject to typical memory leaks of unamanged code, except that references shared between the two are managed by the garbage collector. Could be wrong about this last point.</p>

<p>I'll second Diago's answer.  I use TortoiseSVN on Vista x64 pretty heavily.</p>

<p>I did upgrade directly from an older version to 1.5.2 though, and never used 1.5.1.  Have you tried 1.5.2?</p>
<p>TortoiseSVN in combination with VisualSVN for Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I too get explorer crashes in Vista (I'm not in the 64Bit version though). I'm using Vista Super Saijen (or whatever they are calling the most expensive version). I'm not having any bugs with Tortoise.</p>

<p>My explorer does, however, crash about every other day (sometimes multiple times a day if it's having an "off" day). I'm not positive it's being caused by TortoiseSVN though. From what I hear, the explorer just crashes a lot in Vista...</p>

<p>Have you tried uninstalling Tortoise and using Windows for a day or two and seeing if it still crashes? Do you restart your computer at least once a day (It seems the longer I go between restarts, the worse the crashes get)?</p>
<p>I wound up using this. It is a kind of a hack, but it actually works pretty well. The only thing is you have to be very careful with your semicolons. : D</p>

<pre><code>var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);      
var i:Number = 0;
var strSqlSplit:Array = strSql.split(";");
for (i = 0; i &lt; strSqlSplit.length; i++){
    NonQuery(strSqlSplit[i].toString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This has religious war potential, but it seems to me that if you're using a getter/setter, you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road (e.g. somebody adds code to a setter that <em>needs</em> to run every time that property is set, and the property is being set internally w/o that setter being called).</p>
<p>It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasn't been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database.</p>

<p>Now let's say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called. You may want to not use the Get method from inside the object because it would produce an invalid count.</p>
<p>This may be too basic or limited of a solution, but couldn't you do a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split%28java.lang.String%29" rel="nofollow"><code>String.split()</code></a> on each line of the file, remembering the result array of the first line to generate the XML, and just spit each line's array data out with the proper XML elements padding each iteration of a loop?</p>

<p>Rolling your own PHP solution will certainly work though I'm not sure if there is a good way to automatically duplicate the schema from one DB to the other (maybe this was your question).</p>

<p>If you are just copying data, and/or you need custom code anyway to convert between modified schemas between the two DB's, I would recommend using PHP 5.2+ and the PDO libraries.  You'll be able to connect using PDO ODBC (and use MSSQL drivers).  I had a lot of problems getting large text fields and multi-byte characters from MSSQL into PHP using other libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Am I just going overboard here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps ;)</p>

<p>Another approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:</p>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>public function getName() {<br>    $this-&gt;incrementNameCalled();<br>    return $this-&gt;_getName();<br>}<br><br>protected function _getName() {<br>    return $this-&gt;name;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>and then from within the object itself:</p>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>$name = $this-&gt;_getName();<br></code></pre>

<p>This way you can still use that first argument for something else (like sending a flag for whether or not to used cached data here perhaps). </p>
<p>Another tool to try would be the SQLMaestro suite - http://www.sqlmaestro.com It is a little tricky nailing down the precise tool, but they have a variety of tools, both free and for purchase that handle a wide variety of tasks for multiple database platforms. I'd suggest trying the Data Wizard tool first for MySQL, since I believe that will have the proper "import" tool you need.</p>
<P>Well, it seems with C# 3.0 properties' default implementation, the decision is taken for you; you HAVE to set the property using the (possibly private) property setter.</P>
<P>I personally only use the private member-behind when not doing so would cause the object to fall in an less than desirable state, such as when initializing or when caching/lazy loading is involved.</P>
<p>As stated in some of the comments: Sometimes you should, sometimes you shouldn't. The great part about private variables is that you are able to see all the places they are used when you change something. If your getter/setter does something you need, use it. If it doesn't matter you decide.</p>

<p>The opposite case could be made that if you use the getter/setter and somebody changes the getter/setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up. </p>
<p>The <em>hook</em> and <em>listener</em> method is the most commonly used, but there are other things you can do.  Depending on the size of your app, and who your going to allow see the code (is this going to be a FOSS script, or something in house) will influence greatly how you want to allow plugins.</p>

<p>kdeloach has a nice example, but his implementation and hook function is a little unsafe.  I would ask for you to give more information of the nature of php app your writing, And how you see plugins fitting in.  </p>

<p>+1 to kdeloach from me.</p>
<p>Is the play link a link to the actual mp3 file or to some javascript code that pops up a player? </p>

<p>If the latter, you can easily add your own logging code in there to track the number of hits to it.</p>

<p>If the former, you'll need something that can track the web server log itself and make that distinction. My hosting plan comes with webalizer, which does this nicely.</p>
<p>As of .Net 1.1 the only available method is reaching into the java libraries.<br>

<p>I've always used the SharpZip Library.</p>

<p><a href="http://sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/Download.aspx">Here's a link</a></p>

<p>The funny thing is i wrote a php media gallery for all my music 2 days ago. I had a similar problem.  Im using <a href="http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/">http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/</a> for the player. and the playlis are built via php.  all music request go there a script called xfer.php?file=WHATEVER</p>

<pre><code>$filename = base64_url_decode($_REQUEST['file']);
header("Cache-Control: public");
header("Content-Description: File Transfer");
header('Content-disposition: attachment; filename='.basename($filename));
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
header('Content-Length: '. filesize($filename));

//  Put either file counting code here. either a db or static files

//

readfile($filename);  //and spit the user the file


function base64_url_decode($input) {
    return base64_decode(strtr($input, '-_,', '+/='));
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when you call files use something like </p>

<pre><code>function base64_url_encode($input) {
     return strtr(base64_encode($input), '+/=', '-_,');
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.base64-encode.php">http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.base64-encode.php</a></p>

<p>If you are using some javascript or a flash player (JW player for example) that requires the actual link to be an mp3 file or whatever, you can append the text "&amp;type=.mp3" so the final linke becomes something like "www.example.com/xfer.php?file=34842ffjfjxfh&amp;type=.mp3". That way it looks like it ends with an mp3 extension without affecting the file link.</p>

<P>You could even set up an Apache .htaccess directive that converts *.mp3 requests into the querystring dubayou is working with. It might be an elegant way to keep the direct request and still be able to slipstream log function into the response.</P>
<p>Well, what is the nature of the flat databases.  Are they large or small.  Is it simple arrays with arrays in them?  if its something simple say userprofiles built as such:</p>

<pre><code>$user = array("name" =&gt; "dubayou", 
              "age" =&gt; 20,
              "websites" =&gt; array("dubayou.com","willwharton.com","codecream.com"),
              "and_one" =&gt; "more");
</code></pre>

<p>and to save or update the <em>db record</em> for that user.</p>

<pre><code>$dir = "../userdata/";  //make sure to put it bellow what the server can reach.
file_put_contents($dir.$user['name'],serialize($user));
</code></pre>

<p>and to load the <em>record</em> for the user</p>

<pre><code>function &amp;get_user($name){
    return unserialize(file_get_contents("../userdata/".$name));
}
</code></pre>

<p>but again this implementation will vary on the application and nature of the database you need.</p>

<p>I used to have lots of Explorer crashes (on 32-bit) caused by Tortoise. They seem to have gone away since I used the Include/Exclude path settings in the "Icon Overlays" configuration of TSVN. Constraining icon overlays to specific directories where I keep my source made this much more stable.</p>

<P>Strictly speaking, a memory leak is consuming memory that is "no longer used" by the program.</P>
<P>"No longer used" has more than one meaning, it could mean "no more reference to it", that is, totally unrecoverable, or it could mean, referenced, recoverable, unused but the program keeps the references anyway. Only the later applies to .Net for <STRONG>perfectly managed objects</STRONG>. However, not all classes are perfect and at some point an underlying unmanaged implementation could leak resources permanently for that process.</P>
<P>In all cases, the application consumes more memory than strictly needed. The sides effects, depending on the ammount leaked, could go from none, to slowdown caused by excessive collection, to a series of memory exceptions and finally a fatal error followed by forced process termination.</P>
<P>You know an application has a memory problem when monitoring shows that more and more memory is allocated to your process <STRONG>after each garbage collection cycle</STRONG>. In such case, you are either keeping too much in memory, or some underlying unmanaged implementation is leaking.</P>
<P>For most leaks, resources are recovered when the process is terminated, however some resources are not always recovered in some precise cases, GDI cursor handles are notorious for that. Of course, if you have an interprocess communication mechanism, memory allocated in the other process would not be freed until that process frees it or terminates.</P>
<p>The best way that I have found is the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/migration-toolkit/">MySQL Migration Toolkit</a> provided by MySQL.  I have used it successfully for some large migration projects.</p>
<p>I would define memory leaks as an object not freeing up all the memory allocated after it has completed. I have found this can happen in your application if you are using Windows API and COM (i.e. unmanaged code that has a bug in it or is not being managed correctly), in the framework and in third party components. I have also found not tiding up after using certain objects like pens can cause the issue.</p>

<p>I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications. (OOM can also come from pinning see <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/yunjin/archive/2004/01/27/63642.aspx">Pinning Artical</a>). If you are not getting OOM errors or need to confirm if it is a memory leak causing it then the only way is to profile your application.</p>

<p>I would also try and ensure the following:</p>

<p>a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) </p>

<p>b)Anything that has a close method is closed again using finally or the using statement (although I have found using does not always close depending if you declared the object outside the using statement)</p>

<p>c)If you are using unmanaged code/windows API's that these are dealt with correctly after. (some have clean up methods to release resources)</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>You can use a <a href="http://sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/" rel="nofollow">3rd-party library such as SharpZip</a> as Tom pointed out.</p>

<p>Another way (without going 3rd-party) is to use the Windows Shell API. You'll need to set a reference to the Microsoft Shell Controls and Automation COM library in your C# project. Gerald Gibson has an example at:</p>

<p><s><a href="http://geraldgibson.net/dnn/Home/CZipFileCompression/tabid/148/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://geraldgibson.net/dnn/Home/CZipFileCompression/tabid/148/Default.aspx</a></s> </p>

<p>You can do it by adding the following anywhere in your code </p>

<pre><code>$Id:$
</code></pre>

<p>So for example @Jeff did:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="svnrevision"&gt;svn revision: $Id:$&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and when checked in the server replaced $Id:$ with the current revision number.  I also <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/svnrev.htm" rel="nofollow">found this reference</a>.</p>

<p>There is also <strong>$Date:$</strong>, <strong>$Rev:$</strong>, <strong>$Revision:$</strong></p>

<p>You could use conditional comments to get IE and Firefox to do different things</p>

<p>The browsers themselves will ignore code that isn't meant for them to read.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel like it's important to remain consistent.  If you have getters and setters, use them.  The only time I would access a field directly is when the accessor has a lot of overhead.  It may feel like you're bloating your code unnecessarily, but it can certainly save a whole lot of headache in the future.  The classic example:</p>

<p>Later on, you may desire to change the way that field works.  Maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store.  If you are accessing properties directly, a change like that can break an awful lot of code in one swell foop.</p>
<p>Looks like Jeff is using <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/What+is+CruiseControl.NET" rel="nofollow">CruiseControl.NET</a> based on some leafing through the podcast transcripts.

<p>You can read CSV file with this tool and serialize it to XML.</p>

<p>I don't understand why you would want to do this. It sounds almost like cargo cult coding.</p>

<p>Converting a CSV file to XML doesn't add any value. Your program is already reading the CSV file, so arguing that you need XML doesn't work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, reading the CSV file, doing <em>something</em> with the values, and then serializing to XML does make sense (well, as much as using XML can make sense... ;)) but you would supposedly already have a means of serializing to XML.</p>
<p>This is one of the "hard problems" surrounding development. As far as I know there are no perfect solutions. </p>

<p>If you only need to store the database structure and not the data you can export the database as SQL queries. (in Enterprise Manager: Right click on database -&gt; Generate SQL script. I recommend setting the "create one file per object" on the options tab) You can then commit these text files to svn and make use of svn's diff and logging functions. </p>

<p>I have this tied together with a Batch script that takes a couple parameters and sets up the database. I also added some additional queries that enter default data like user types and the admin user. (If you want more info on this, post something and I can put the script somewhere accessible)</p>

<p>If you need to keep all of the data as well, I recommend keeping a back up of the database and using Redgate (http://www.red-gate.com/) products to do the comparisons. They don't come cheap, but they are worth every penny. </p>
<p>Hey, I'm still stuck in that camp too. The third party application we have to support is FINALLY going to 2K5, so we're almost out of the wood. But I feel your pain 8^D</p>

<p>That said, from everything I heard from our DBA, the key is to convert the database to 8.0 format first, and then go to 2005. I believe they used the built in migration/upgrade tools for this. There are some big steps between 6.5 and 8.0 that are better solved there than going from 6.5 to 2005 directly.</p>

<p>Your BIGGEST pain, if you didn't know already, is that DTS is gone in favor of SSIS. There is a shell type module that will run your existing DTS packages, but you're going to want to manually recreate them all in SSIS. Ease of this will depend on the complexity of the packages themselves, but I've done a few at work so far and they've been pretty smooth.</p>
<p>I've read somewhere the human eye can't distinguish between less than 4 values apart. so This is something to keep in mind. The following algorithm does not compensate for this.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:</p>

<p>(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)</p>

<pre><code>//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]<br>colors = []; //holds final colors to be used<br>rand = new Random();<br><br>//assumes n is less than 16,777,216<br>randomGen(int n){<br>   while (len(colors) &lt; n){<br>      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color<br>      newRed = rand.next(256);<br>      newGreen = rand.next(256);<br>      newBlue = rand.next(256);<br>      temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];<br>      //only adds new colors to the array<br>      if temp not in colors {<br>         colors.append(temp);<br>      }<br>   }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:</p>

<pre><code>for item in color{<br>   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   dist = itemSq - tempSq;<br>   dist = abs(dist);<br>}<br>//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.<br>if dist &lt; NUMBER and temp not in colors {<br>   colors.append(temp);<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.</p>

<p>Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example.</p>
<p>You can try turning Check-constraints off on the DataSet (it's in its properties), or altering the properties of that relationship, and change the key to a simple reference - up to you.</p>

<p>To set the <em>Apache</em> (<em>not the PHP</em>) log, the easiest way to do this would be to do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost IP:Port&gt;
   # Stuff,
   # More Stuff,
   ErrorLog /path/where/you/want/the/error.log
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

<p>I don't know the ASP.NET side of the problem but .NET has a pretty powerful class: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx">System.Globalization.CultureInfo</a>. You can use the following code to parse a string containing a double value:</p>

<pre><code>double d = double.Parse("100.20", CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);<br>//  -- OR --<br>double d = double.Parse("100.20", CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture);<br></code></pre>

<p>If ASP.NET somehow (i.e. using HTTP Request headers) passes current user's CultureInfo to either CultureInfo.CurrentCulture or CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture, these will work fine.</p>
<p>You can't please everyone.  If I enter ten as 10.000, and someone enters ten thousand as 10.000, you cannot handle that without some knowledge of the culture of the input.  Detect the culture somehow (browser, system setting - what is the use case?  ASP?  Internal app, or open to the world?), or provide an example of the expected formatting, and use the most lenient parser you can.  Probably something like:</p>

<pre><code>double d = Double.Parse("5,000.00", NumberStyles.Any, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);<br></code></pre>
<p>Another function, not my me but found on the web and a bit refined:</p>

<pre><code>public static int GetAge(DateTime birthDate)
{
    DateTime n = DateTime.Now; // To avoid a race condition around midnight
    int age = n.Year - birthDate.Year;

    if (n.Month &lt; birthDate.Month || (n.Month == birthDate.Month &amp;&amp; n.Day &lt; birthDate.Day))
        age--;

    return age;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just two things that come into my mind: What about people from countries that do not use the gregorian calendar? DateTime.Now is in the server-specific culture i think. I have absolutely 0 knowledge about actually working with Asian calendars and I do not know if there is an easy way to convert dates between calendars, but just in case you're wondering about those chinese guys from the year 4660 :-)</p>

<p>From what I've seen, there are a few registry keys that set the default mail client. One of them being:</p>

<p>System Key: <code>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command]</code></p>

<p>Value Name: <code>(Default)</code></p>

<p>Data Type: <code>REG_SZ</code> (String Value)</p>

<p>Value Data: <code>Mail program command-line</code>. </p>

<p>I'm not familar with <code>Delphi 7</code>, but I'm sure there are some <em>registry editing libraries</em> in there that you could use to modify this value.</p>

<p>Some places list more than this <em>key</em>, others just this key, so you may need to test a little bit to find the proper one(s).</p>

<p>Here is the official Microsoft Solution to programmatically change the default mail client. It's Visual Basic, but I hope the concept is clear from this:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299853" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299853</a></p>

<p>The default behaviour is for error_log() to output to the Apache error log.  If this isn't happening check your php.ini settings for the error_log directive - leave it unset to use the Apache log file for the current vhost.</p>
<p>The functionality you're looking for is traditionally called an UPSERT. Atleast knowing what it's called might help you find what you're looking for.</p>

<p>I don't think SQL Server 2005 has any great ways of doing this. 2008 introduces the MERGE statement that can be used to accomplish this as shown in: <a href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3739131">http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3739131</a> or <a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/davidportas/archive/2007/11/14/SQL-Server-2008-MERGE.aspx">http://blogs.conchango.com/davidportas/archive/2007/11/14/SQL-Server-2008-MERGE.aspx</a></p>

<p>Merge was available in the beta of 2005, but they removed it out in the final release.</p>
<p>What the upsert/merge is doing is something to the effect of...</p>

<pre><code>IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM [Table] WHERE Id = X)
   UPDATE [Table] SET...
ELSE
   INSERT INTO [Table]
</code></pre>

<p>So hopefully the combination of those articles and this pseudo code can get things moving.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head...</p>

<pre><code>$artist = array("the roots","michael jackson","billy idol","more","and more","and_YET_MORE");<br>$count = array(5,3,9,1,1,3);<br>$highest = max($count);<br>for (int $x = 0; x &lt; count($artist); $x++)<br>{<br>    $normalized = $count[$x] / $highest;<br>    $heading = ceil($normalized * 6); // 6 heading types<br>    echo "&lt;h".$heading."&gt;".$artist[$x]."&lt;/h".$heading."&gt;";<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>I think the best you can do in this case is to take their input and then show them what you think they meant. If they disagree, show them the format you're expecting and get them to enter it again.</p>
<p>Any assemblies that are expected to be in the GAC should stay in the GAC. This includes System.web.dll or any other 3rd party dll that you'll deploy to the GAC in production. This means a new developer would have to install these assemblies.</p>

<p>All other 3rd party assemblies should be references through a relative path. My typical structure is:</p>

<pre><code>-Project<br>--Project.sln<br>--References<br>---StructureMap.dll<br>---NUnit.dll<br>---System.Web.Mvc.dll<br>--Project.Web<br>---Project.Web.Proj<br>---Project.Web.Proj files<br>--Project<br>---Project.Proj<br>---Project.Proj files<br></code></pre>

<p>Project.Web and Project reference the assemblies in the root/References folder relatively. These .dlls are checked into subversion.</p>

<p>Aside from that, */bin  */bin/* obj  should be in your global ignore path.</p>

<p>With this setup, all references to assemblies are either through the GAC (so should work across all computers), or relative to each project within your solution.</p>
<p>Is this a .Net specific question?</p>

<p>Generally the best practice is to not check in anything which is built automatically from files that are already in SCM.  All of that is ideally created as part of your automatic build process.</p>

<p>If the <code>bin</code> directory you're referring to contains third-party binaries, rather than a build of your project, ignore (downvote?) this advice.</p>
<p>Yes, I thought about that, but I soon figured out that another Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) would be a bit too much.</p>

<p>Essentially, they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule "When this cards enter play, all your undead minions gain +3 attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed". As trading card games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the card needs.</p>

<p>If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.</p>

<p>That's why I wanted to stay with a "real" .NET language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way (within the limits of the code access security).</p>

<p>That's correct but it actually makes the tags with the least number, larger.  This code has been tested:</p>

<pre><code>$artist = array("the roots","michael jackson","billy idol","more","and more","and_YET_MORE");<br>$count = array(5,3,9,1,1,3);<br>$highest = max($count);<br>for ($x = 0; $x &lt; count($artist); $x++) {<br>    $normalized =  ($highest - $count[$x]+1) / $highest;<br>    $heading = ceil($normalized * 6); // 6 heading types<br>    echo "&lt;h$heading&gt;{$artist[$x]}&lt;/h$heading&gt;";<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>It may be worth looking into that.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I can't think of anything beyond the Web Browser control.</p>
<p>Looking around, and using some C# 3.0 features we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string,int&gt; item in keywordCounts.OrderBy(key=&gt; key.Value))
{ 
    // do something with item.Key and item.Value
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the cleanest way I've seen and is similar to the Ruby way of handling hashes.</p>

<p>On a high level, you have no other choice then to walk through the whole Dictionary and look at each value.</p>

<p>Maybe this helps:

Copy/Pasting from John Timney:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; s = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
s.Add("1", "a Item");
s.Add("2", "c Item");
s.Add("3", "b Item");

List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; myList = new List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;(s);
myList.Sort(
    delegate(KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; firstPair,
    KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; nextPair)
    {
        return firstPair.Value.CompareTo(nextPair.Value);
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>I usually just specify this in an <code>.htaccess</code> file <em>or</em> the <code>vhost.conf</code> on the domain I'm working on. Add this to one of these files:</p>

<pre><code>php_admin_value error_log "/var/www/vhosts/example.com/error_log"
</code></pre>

<pre><code>using System.Linq.Enumerable;
...
List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; myList = aDictionary.ToList();

myList.Sort(
    delegate(KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; pair1,
    KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt; pair2)
    {
        return pair1.Value.CompareTo(pair2.Value);
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're targeting .net 2.0 or above, you can simplify this into lambda syntax -- it's equivalent but shorter. If you're targeting .net 2.0 you can only use this syntax if you're using the compiler from vs2008 (or above).</p>

<pre><code>var myList = aDictionary.ToList();

myList.Sort((pair1,pair2) =&gt; pair1.Value.CompareTo(pair2.Value));
</code></pre>

<p>Try removing the <code>0x</code> first and then call <code>Encoding.UTF8.GetString</code>. I think that may work.</p>

<p>Essentially: 0x44004500</p>

<p>Remove the 0x, and then always two bytes are one character:</p>

<pre><code>44 00 = D

45 00 = E

6F 00 = o

72 00 = r
</code></pre>

<p>So it's definitely a Unicode/UTF format with two bytes/character.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8656/C-Script-The-Missing-Puzzle-Piece">Oleg Shilo's C# Script solution (at The Code Project</a>) really is a great introduction to providing script abilities in your application.</p>

<p>A different approach would be to consider a language that is specifically built for scripting, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronRuby">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython">IronPython</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_%28programming_language%29">Lua</a>.</p>

<p>IronPython and IronRuby are both available today.</p>

<p>That codebase is a great read if you want to learn about building a compiler in .NET.</p>

<p>Most database engines should support dumping your database into a file. I know MySQL does, anyway. This will just be a text file, so you could submit that to Subversion, or whatever you use. It'd be easy to run a diff on the files too.</p>
<p>One guideline is to call <a href="http://www.php.net/session_regenerate_id" rel="nofollow">session_regenerate_id</a> every time a session's security level changes.  This helps prevent session hijacking.</p>
<p>I think one of the major problems (which is being addressed in PHP 6) is register_globals. Right now one of the standard methods used to avoid <code>register_globals</code> is to use the <code>$_REQUEST</code>, <code>$_GET</code> or <code>$_POST</code> arrays.</p>

<p>The "correct" way to do it (as of 5.2, although it's a little buggy there, but stable as of 6, which is coming soon) is through <a href="http://us.php.net/filter" rel="nofollow">filters</a>.</p>

<p>So instead of:</p>

<pre><code>$username = $_POST["username"];
</code></pre>

<p>you would do:</p>

<pre><code>$username = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'username', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
</code></pre>

<p>or even just:</p>

<pre><code>$username = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'username');
</code></pre>

<p>I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a "multimedia driver" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.</p>

<p>My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.</p>

<p>I would reference something like a <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextdocument.html">QTextDocument</a> in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.</p>

<p>This is pretty trivial and obvious, but be sure to <a href="http://www.php.net/session_destroy" rel="nofollow">session_destroy</a> after every use. This can be difficult to implement if the user does not log out explicitly, so a timer can be set to do this.</p>

<p>Here is a good <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/javascript-timers-with-settimeout-and-setinterval/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> on setTimer() and clearTimer().</p>
<p><a href="http://diveintopython.net/xml_processing/">Dive Into Python</a> has a chapter. Can't vouch for how good it would be though.</p>

<p>I was glad to find <a href="http://coding.derkeiler.com/Archive/C_CPP/comp.lang.c/2004-02/1382.html">a good conversation</a> on this subject, as I hadn't really given it much thought before.</p>

<p>In summary, signed is a good general choice - even when you're dead sure all the numbers are positive - if you're going to do arithmetic on the variable (like in a typical for loop case).  </p>

<p>If you're going to do bitwise things like masks, unsigned starts to make more sense.  Or, if you're desperate to get that extra positive range by taking advantage of the sign bit.</p>

<p>Personally, I like signed because I don't trust myself to stay consistent and avoid mixing the two types (like the article warns against).</p>
<p>Personally, I've played with several of the built-in options on an XML-heavy project and have settled on <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-xml.dom.pulldom.html">pulldom</a> as the best choice for less complex documents.</p>

<p>Especially for small simple stuff, I like the event-driven theory of parsing rather than setting up a whole slew of callbacks for a relatively simple structure.  <a href="http://www.prescod.net/python/pulldom.html">Here is a good quick discussion of how to use the API</a>.</p>

<p>What I like: you can handle the parsing in a <code>for</code> loop rather than using callbacks.  You also delay full parsing (the "pull" part) and only get additional detail when you call <code>expandNode()</code>.  This satisfies my general requirement for "responsible" efficiency without sacrificing ease of use and simplicity.</p>
<p>You might be able to use IronRuby for that. </p>

<p>Otherwise I'd suggest you have a directory where you place precompiled assemblies. Then you could have a reference in the DB to the assembly and class, and use reflection to load the proper assemblies at runtime.</p>

<p>If you really want to compile at run-time you could use the CodeDOM, then you could use reflection to load the dynamic assembly. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.csharp.csharpcodeprovider.aspx">MSDN article which might help</a>.</p>
<p>In your example above, when 'i' will always be positive and a higher range would be beneficial, unsigned would be useful. Like if you're using 'declare' statements, such as: </p>

<pre><code>#declare BIT1 (unsigned int 1)<br>#declare BIT32 (unsigned int reallybignumber)<br></code></pre>

<p>Especially when these values will never change.</p>

<p>However, if you're doing an accounting program where the people are irresponsible with their money and are constantly in the red, you will most definitely want to use 'signed'.</p>

<p>I do agree with saint though that a good rule of thumb is to use signed, which C actually defaults to, so you're covered.</p>
<p>Take a look at the CHECKSUM command:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*)) FROM sample_table WITH (NOLOCK);
</code></pre>

<p>That will return the same number each time it's run as long as the table contents haven't changed. See my post on this for more information:</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa258245%28SQL.80%29.aspx">CHECKSUM</a></p>

<p>Here's how I used it to rebuild cache dependencies when tables changed:<br>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2005/05/07/406056.aspx">ASP.NET 1.1 database cache dependency (without triggers)</a></p>

<p><code>size_t</code> is often a good choice for this, or <code>size_type</code> if you're using an STL class.</p>

<p>For Oracle, I use <a href="http://www.toadsoft.com/">Toad</a>, which can dump a schema to a number of discrete files (e.g., one file per table).  I have some scripts that manage this collection in Perforce, but I think it should be easily doable in just about any revision control system.</p>

<p>Edit: P.S. This is untested.</p>

<P>You could use any of the DLR languages, which provide a way to really easily host your own scripting platform. However, you don't have to use a scripting language for this. You could use C# and compile it with the C# code provider. As long as you load it in its own AppDomain, you can load and unload it to your heart's content.</P>
<p>In Ruby on Rails, there's a concept of a <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingMigrations">migration</a> -- a quick script to change the database.</p>

<p>You generate a migration file, which has rules to increase the db version (such as adding a column) and rules to downgrade the version (such as removing a column). Each migration is numbered, and a table keeps track of your current db version.</p>

<p>To _migrate up_, you run a command called "db:migrate" which looks at your version and applies the needed scripts. You can migrate down in a similar way.</p>

<p>The migration scripts themselves are kept in a version control system -- whenever you change the database you check in a new script, and any developer can apply it to bring their local db to the latest version.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this. Common methods use recursion, memoization, or dynamic programming. The basic idea is that you produce a list of all strings of length 1, then in each iteration, for all strings produced in the last iteration, add that string concatenated with each character in the string individually. (the variable index in the code below keeps track of the start of the last and the next iteration)</p>

<p>Some pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>list = originalString.split('')
index = (0,0)
list = [""]
for iteration n in 1 to y:
  index = (index[1], len(list))
  for string s in list.subset(index[0] to end):
    for character c in originalString:
      list.add(s + c)
</code></pre>

<p>you'd then need to remove all strings less than x in length, they'll be the first (x-1) * len(originalString) entries in the list.</p>

<p>There's a PHP5 "database migration framework" called Ruckusing. I haven't used it, but the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruckusing/wiki/CompleteExamples">examples</a> show the idea, if you use the language to create the database as and when needed, you only have to track source files.</p>
<p>I just whipped this up quick in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>def perms(x, y, possible_characters)<br>  all = [""]<br>  current_array = all.clone<br>  1.upto(y) { |iteration|<br>    next_array = []<br>    current_array.each { |string|<br>      possible_characters.each { |c|<br>        value = string + c<br>        next_array.insert next_array.length, value<br>        all.insert all.length, value<br>      }<br>    }<br>    current_array = next_array<br>  }<br>  all.delete_if { |string| string.length &lt; x }<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>You might look into language API for built in permutation type functions, and you might be able to write more optimized code, but if the numbers are all that high, I'm not sure there is much of a way around having a lot of results.</p>

<p>Anyways, the idea behind the code is start with string of length 0, then keep track of all the strings of length Z where Z is the current size in the iteration.  Then, go through each string and append each character onto each string.  Finally at the end, remove any that were below the x threshold and return the result.</p>

<p>I didn't test it with potentially meaningless input (null character list, weird values of x and y, etc).</p>
<p><strong>High Resolution, Low Overhead Timing for Intel Processors</strong></p>

<p>If you're on Intel hardware, here's how to read the CPU real-time instruction counter.  It will tell you the number of CPU cycles executed since the processor was booted.  This is probably the finest-grained counter you can get for performance measurement.</p>

<p>Note that this is the number of CPU cycles.  On linux you can get the CPU speed from /proc/cpuinfo and divide to get the number of seconds.  Converting this to a double is quite handy.</p>

<p>When I run this on my box, I get</p>

<pre><code>11867927879484732
11867927879692217
it took this long to call printf: 207485
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://cs.smu.ca/~jamuir/rdtscpm1.pdf">Intel developer's guide</a> that  gives tons of detail.</p>

    y = rdtsc();
    printf("%lld\n",y);
    printf("it took this long to call printf: %lld\n",y-x);

<p>Personally I would do something like this:</p>

<p>Assuming I'm not a complete idiot this should work. But it is untested.</p>

<p>You can tell your users to add your From address to their contacts when they complete their order, which, if they do so, will help a lot.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I would try to get a log from some of your users. Sometimes they have details about why it was flagged as spam in the headers of the message, which you could use to tweak the text.</p>

<p>Other things you can try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put your site name or address in the subject</li>
<li>Keep all links in the message pointing to your domain (and not email.com)</li>
<li>Put an address or other contact information in the email</li>
</ul>
<p>This warning is there because Java is not actually storing type information at run-time in an object that uses generics.  Thus, if <code>object</code> is actually a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, there will be no <code>ClassCastException</code> at run-time except until an item is accessed from the list that doesn't match the generic type defined in the variable.  </p>

<p>This can cause further complications if items are added to the list, with this incorrect generic type information.  Any code still holding a reference to the list but with the correct generic type information will now have an inconsistent list.  </p>

<p>To remove the warning, try:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;?&gt; list = (List&lt;?&gt;) object;
</code></pre>

<p>However, note that you will not be able to use certain methods such as add because the compiler doesn't know if you are trying to add an object of incorrect type.  The above will work in a lot of situations, but if you have to use add, or some similarly restricted method, you will just have to suffer the yellow underline in Eclipse (or a <code>SuppressWarning</code> annotation).</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you would want to do this in the first place. The resulting set for any moderately large values of x and y will be huge, and will grow exponentially as x and/or y get bigger. </p>

<p>Lets say your set of possible characters is the 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet, and you ask your application to generate all permutations where length = 5. Assuming you don't run out of memory you'll get 11,881,376 (i.e. 26 to the power of 5) strings back. Bump that length up to 6, and you'll get 308,915,776 strings back. These numbers get painfully large, very quickly.</p>

<p>Here's a solution I put together in Java. You'll need to provide two runtime arguments (corresponding to x and y). Have fun.</p>

<pre><code>public class GeneratePermutations {<br>    public static void main(String[] args) {<br>        int lower = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);<br>        int upper = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);<br><br>        if (upper &lt; lower || upper == 0 || lower == 0) {<br>            System.exit(0);<br>        }<br><br>        for (int length = lower; length &lt;= upper; length++) {<br>            generate(length, "");<br>        }<br>    }<br><br>    private static void generate(int length, String partial) {<br>        if (length &lt;= 0) {<br>            System.out.println(partial);<br>        } else {<br>            for (char c = 'a'; c &lt;= 'z'; c++) {<br>                generate(length - 1, partial + c);<br>            }<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>The <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/search/Similarity.html" rel="nofollow">scoring</a> contains the Inverse Document Frequency(IDF). If the term "John Smith" is in one partition, 0, 100 times and in partition 1, once. The score for searching for John Smith would be higher search in partition 1 as the term is more scarce.</p>

<p>To get round this you would wither have to have your index being over all partitions, or you would need to override the IDF.</p>

<p>Because the score is determined on the Index if I am not completely mistaken. If you have different indexes (more/less or different data that was indexed), the score will differ:</p>

<p><s>The best way to deploy video on the web is using Flash - it's much easier to embed cleanly into a web page and will play on more or less any browser and platform combination. The only reason to use Windows Media Player is if you're streaming content and you need extraordinarily strong digital rights management, and even then providers are now starting to use Flash even for these. See BBC's iPlayer for a superb example.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you switch to Flash even for internal use. You never know who is going to need to access it in the future, and this will give you the best possible future compatibility.</s></p>

<p>EDIT - March 20 2013. 
Interesting how these old questions resurface from time to time! How different the world is today and how dated this all seems. I would not recommend a Flash only route today by any means - best practice these days would probably be to use HTML 5 to embed H264 encoded video, with a Flash fallback as described here: <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html" rel="nofollow">http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html</a></p>

<p>If the fact that the first button is used by default is consistent across browsers, why not put them the right way round in the source code, then use CSS to switch their apparent positions? <code>float</code> them left and right to switch them around visually, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> has a nice pythony API.  I think it's even shipped as part of python 2.5</p>

<p>It's in pure python and as I say, pretty nice, but if you wind up needing more performance, then <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a> exposes the same API and uses libxml2 under the hood.  You can theoretically just swap it in when you discover you need it.</p>
<p>No, what you're doing is fine. Don't let those people confuse you.</p>

<p>If you've written the web services with .net then the reference proxies generated by .net are going to be quite suitable. The situation you describe (where you are both producer and consumer) is the ideal situation.</p>

<p>If you need to connect to a web services that is <em>unknown</em> at compile time, then you would want a more dynamic approach, where you deduce the 'shape' of the web service. </p>

<p>But start by using the auto generated proxy class, and don't worry about it until you hit a limitation. And when you do -- come back to stack overflow ;-)</p>
<p>You should almost certainly not be extending the session cookie to be long lived.</p>

<p>Although not dealing specifically with rails <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/01/19/persistent_login_cookie_best_practice">this article</a> goes to some length to explain 'remember me' best practices.</p>

<p>In summary though you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add an extra column to the user table to accept a large random value</li>
<li>Set a long lived cookie on the client which combines the user id and the random value</li>
<li>When a new session starts, check for the existence of the id/value cookie and authenticate the new user if they match.</li>
</ul>

<p>The author also recommends invalidating the random value and resetting the cookie at every login.  Personally I don't like that as you then can't stay logged into a site on two computers.  I would tend to make sure my password changing function also reset the random value thus locking out sessions on other machines. </p>

<p>As a final note, the advice he gives on making certain functions (password change/email change etc) unavailable to auto authenticated sessions is well worth following but rarely seen in the real world.</p>

<p>Warning: there may be alot to wade through.</p>
<p>This has to do with how data bindings are set up in the dotnet framework, especially the <code>BindingContext</code>. On a high level it means that if you haven't specified otherwise each form and all the controls of the form share the same <code>BindingContext</code>. When you are setting the <code>DataSource</code> property the <code>ComboBox</code> will use the <code>BindingContext</code> to get a <code>ConcurrenyMangager</code> that wraps the list. The <code>ConcurrenyManager</code> keeps track of such things as the current selected position in the list. </p>

<p>When you set the <code>DataSource</code> of the second <code>ComboBox</code> it will use the same <code>BindingContext</code> (the forms) which will yield a reference to the same <code>ConcurrencyManager</code> as above used to set up the data bindings.</p>

<p>Martin Fowler wrote my favorite article on the subject, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html">http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html</a>.  I choose not to put schema dumps in under version control as <em>alumb</em> and others suggest because I want an easy way to upgrade my production database.</p>

<p>For a web application where I'll have a single production database instance, I use two techniques:</p>

<h1>Database Upgrade Scripts</h1>

<p>A sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the DDL necessary to move the schema from version N to N+1.  (These go in your version control system.)  A <em>version_history</em> table, something like</p>

<pre><code>create table VersionHistory (<br>    Version int primary key,<br>    UpgradeStart datetime not null,<br>    UpgradeEnd datetime<br>    );<br></code></pre>

<p>gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new version.</p>

<p>This ensures that it's easy to see what version of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once.  Again, these are <strong>not</strong> database dumps.  Rather, each script represents the <strong>changes</strong> necessary to move from one version to the next.  They're the script that you apply to your production database to "upgrade" it.</p>

<h1>Developer Sandbox Synchronization</h1>

<ol>
<li>A script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database.  Run this after each upgrade to the production DB.</li>
<li>A script to restore (and tweak, if necessary) the backup on a developer's workstation.  Each developer runs this script after each upgrade to the production DB.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>A caveat: My automated tests run against a schema-correct but empty database, so this advice will not perfectly suit your needs.</em></p>
<p>I haven't been able to find anything that does this directly.  I think you'll have to iterate through the various font folders on the system: <code>/System/Library/Fonts</code>, <code>/Library/Fonts</code>, and there can probably be a user-level directory as well <code>~/Library/Fonts</code>.</p>

<p>Using fcgi with Ruby is known to be very buggy. </p>

<p>Practically everybody has moved to <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> for this reason, and I recommend you do the same.</p>
<p>You didn't mention any specifics about your target environment or constraints, so this may not be entirely applicable... but if you're looking for a way to effectively track an evolving DB schema and aren't adverse to the idea of using Ruby, ActiveRecord's migrations are right up your alley.</p>

<p>Migrations programatically define database transformations using a Ruby DSL; each transformation can be applied or (usually) rolled back, allowing you to jump to a different version of your DB schema at any given point in time. The file defining these transformations can be checked into version control like any other piece of source code.</p>

<p>Because migrations are a part of <a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.com/">ActiveRecord</a>, they typically find use in full-stack Rails apps; however, you can use ActiveRecord independent of Rails with minimal effort. See <a href="http://rails.aizatto.com/2007/05/27/activerecord-migrations-without-rails/">here</a> for a more detailed treatment of using AR's migrations outside of Rails.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So it says microseconds explicitly, but says the resolution of the system clock is unspecified. I suppose resolution in this context means how the smallest amount it will ever be incremented?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data structure is defined as having microseconds as a unit of measurement, but that doesn't mean that the clock or operating system is actually capable of measuring that finely.</p>

<p>Like other people have suggested, <code>gettimeofday()</code> is bad because setting the time can cause clock skew and throw off your calculation.  <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> is what you want, and <code>clock_getres()</code> will tell you the precision of your clock.</p>

<p>Since you mentioned that you'll be building "fairly simple" XML, the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.dom.minidom.html" rel="nofollow">minidom module</a> (part of the Python Standard Library) will likely suit your needs. If you have any experience with the DOM representation of XML, you should find the API quite straight forward.</p>
<p>Isn't it also a factor which order you set up the colors?</p>

<p>Like if you use Dillie-Os idea you need to mix the colors as much as possible. 
0 64 128 256 is from one to the next. but 0 256 64 128 in a wheel would be more "apart"</p>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>
<p>Doesn't this depend on the hardware as well as number of threads and stuff?</p>

<p>I would make a simple test and run it with increasing amounts of threads hammering and see what seems best.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo method</a>, as mentioned, applies some great concepts but it is, clearly, not the fastest --not by a long shot, not by any reasonable usefulness. Also, it all depends on what kind of accuracy you are looking for. The fastest pi I know of is the digits hard coded. Looking at <a href="http://functions.wolfram.com/Constants/Pi/">Pi</a> and <a href="http://functions.wolfram.com/PDF/Pi.pdf">Pi[PDF]</a>, there are a lot of formulas.</p>

<p>Here is a method that converges quickly (~14digits per iteration). The current fastest application, <a href="http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/PiProgram/pifast.html">PiFast</a>, uses this formula with the <a href="http://www.ele.uri.edu/~hansenj/projects/ele436/fft.pdf">FFT</a>. I'll just write the formula, since the code is straight forward. This formula was almost found by <a href="http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Pi/piramanujan.html">Ramanujan and discovered by Chudnovsky</a>. It is actually how he calculated several billion digits of the number --so it isn't a method to disregard. The formula will overflow quickly since we are dividing factorials, it would be advantageous then to delay such calculating to remove terms.</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>Below is the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Brent-SalaminFormula.html">Brent–Salamin algorithm</a>. Wikipedia mentions that when a and b are 'close enough' then (a+b)^2/4t will be an approximation of pi. I'm not sure what 'close enough' means, but from my tests, one iteration got 2digits, two got 7, and three had 15, of course this is with doubles, so it might have error based on its representation and the 'true' calculation could be more accurate.</p>

<pre><code>let pi_2 iters =
    let rec loop_ a b t p i =
        if i = 0 then a,b,t,p
        else
            let a_n = (a +. b) /. 2.0 
            and b_n = sqrt (a*.b)
            and p_n = 2.0 *. p in
            let t_n = t -. (p *. (a -. a_n) *. (a -. a_n)) in
            loop_ a_n b_n t_n p_n (i - 1)
    in 
    let a,b,t,p = loop_ (1.0) (1.0 /. (sqrt 2.0)) (1.0/.4.0) (1.0) iters in
    (a +. b) *. (a +. b) /. (4.0 *. t)
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, how about some pi golf (800 digits)? 160 characters!</p>

<pre><code>int a=10000,b,c=2800,d,e,f[2801],g;main(){for(;b-c;)f[b++]=a/5;for(;d=0,g=c*2;c-=14,printf("%.4d",e+d/a),e=d%a)for(b=c;d+=f[b]*a,f[b]=d%--g,d/=g--,--b;d*=b);}
</code></pre>

<p>Maven helps quite a lot with this problem when I'm coding java. We commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies.
For me that seems like a nice way to do it.</p>
<p>You can use ImageMagick's convert utility for this, see some examples in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413111338/http://studio.imagemagick.org/pipermail/magick-users/2002-May/002636.html" rel="nofollow">http://studio.imagemagick.org/pipermail/magick-users/2002-May/002636.html</a>

</blockquote>

<p>A few things:</p>

<p>You are creating (and not using) an unnecessary toplevel window, named <code>window</code>.  You can just delete these lines:</p>

<pre><code>window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);<br>g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "delete_event", G_CALLBACK(delete_event), NULL);<br>g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "destroy", G_CALLBACK(destroy), NULL);<br></code></pre>

<p>Also, the flow doesn't seem quite right.  <code>gtk_main()</code> starts the GTK main loop, which blocks until something exits it.  <code>gtk_dialog_run()</code> also starts a main loop, but it exits as soon as one of the buttons is clicked.</p>

<p>I think it might be enough for you to remove the <code>gtk_init_add()</code> and <code>gtk_main()</code> calls, and simply deal with the return value.  Also the <code>gtk_widget_destroy()</code> call is unnecessary, as the dialog window is automatically destroyed when gtk_dialog_run() returns.</p>
<p>One possibility is Hudson.  It's written in Java, but there's integration with Python projects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://redsolo.blogspot.com/2007/11/hudson-embraces-python.html" rel="nofollow">Hudson embraces Python</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've never tried it myself, however.</p>

<p>(<strong>Update</strong>, Sept. 2011: After a trademark dispute Hudson has been renamed to <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" rel="nofollow">Jenkins</a>.)</p>

<p>My first thought on this is "how generate N vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other." You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/RandomPointPicking.html">Random Point Picking</a>. Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say:</p>

<p>n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/561/using-combinations-of-sets-as-test-data#794">buckles algorithm 515</a> to find the lexicographically indexed color.<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEuCs.gif" alt="\frac {\binom {256^3} {3}} {n} * i">. You'll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there's no ready-made library to do this for you, but producing a tool capable of translating from CSV to XML should only require you to write a crude CSV parser and hook up JDOM (or your XML Java library of choice) with some glue code.</p>

<p>We run <a href="http://buildbot.net/trac">Buildbot - Trac</a> at work, I haven't used it too much since my code base isn't part of the release cycle yet. But we run the tests on different environments (OSX/Linux/Win) and it sends emails --and it's written in python.</p>

<h3>Sending credentials</h3>

<p>The only practical way to send credentials 100% securely is by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a>. Using JavaScript to hash the password is not safe. Common pitfalls for client-side password hashing:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the connection between the client and server is unencrypted, everything you do is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14907581/ssl-and-man-in-the-middle-misunderstanding">vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks</a>. An attacker could replace the incoming javascript to break the hashing or send all credentials to their server, they could listen to client responses and impersonate the users perfectly, etc. etc. SSL with trusted Certificate Authorities is designed to prevent MitM attacks.</li>
<li>The hashed password received by the server is <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/45254/owasp-recommendation-on-client-side-password-hashing">less secure</a> if you don't do additional, redundant work on the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's another secure method called <strong>SRP</strong>, but it's patented (although it is <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/license.txt">freely licensed</a>) and there are few good implementations available.</p>

<h3>Storing passwords</h3>

<p>Don't ever store passwords as plaintext in the database. Not even if you don't care about the security of your own site. Assume that some of your users will reuse the password of their online bank account. So, store the hashed password, and throw away the original. And make sure the password doesn't show up in access logs or application logs. The best hashing function seems to be <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage"><strong>bcrypt</strong></a>. </p>

<p>Hashes by themselves are also insecure. For instance, identical passwords mean identical hashes--this makes hash lookup tables an effective way of cracking lots of passwords at once. Instead, store the <strong>salted</strong> hash. A salt is a string appended to the password prior to hashing - use a different (random) salt per user. The salt is a public value, so you can store them with the hash in the database. See <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/704865/Salted-Password-Hashing-Doing-it-Right">here</a> for more on this.</p>

<p>This means that you can't send the user their forgotten passwords (because you only have the hash). Don't reset the user's password unless you have authenticated the user (users must prove that they are able to read emails sent to the stored (and validated) email address.)</p>

<h3>Security questions</h3>

<p>Security questions are insecure - avoid using them. Why? Anything a security question does, a password does better. Read <strong><em>PART III: Using Secret Questions</em></strong> in <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/license.txt">@Jens Roland answer</a> here in this wiki.</p>

<h3>Session cookies</h3>

<p>After the user logs in, the server sends the user a session cookie. The server can retrieve the username or id from the cookie, but nobody else can generate such a cookie (TODO explain mechanisms).</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking">Cookies can be hijacked</a>: they are only as secure as the rest of the client's machine and other communications. They can be read from disk, sniffed in network traffic, lifted by a cross-site scripting attack, phished from a poisoned DNS so the client sends their cookies to the wrong servers. Don't send persistent cookies. Cookies should expire at the end of the client session (browser close or leaving your domain).</p>

<p>If you want to autologin your users, you can set a persistent cookie, but it should be distinct from a full-session cookie. You can set an additional flag that the user has auto-logged in, and needs to login for real for sensitive operations. This is popular with shopping sites that want to provide you with a seamless, personalized shopping experience but still protect your financial details. For example, when you return to visit Amazon, they show you a page that looks like you're logged in, but when you go to place an order (or change your shipping address, credit card etc.), they ask you to confirm your password.</p>

<p>Financial web sites such as banks and credit cards, on the other hand, only have sensitive data and should not allow auto-login or a low-security mode.</p>

<p><strong>In Java,</strong> the 'int' type is a primitive , whereas the 'Integer' type is an object.</p>

<p><strong>In C#,</strong> the 'int' type is the same as <code>System.Int32</code> and is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1ax56ch.aspx">a value type</a> (ie more like the java 'int'). An integer (just like any other value types) can be <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx">boxed</a> ("wrapped") into an object. </p>

<hr>

<p>The differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: </p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong> provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation">heap</a>. Conversely, <strong>primitives</strong> are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation">stack</a>.</p>

<p>Well, in Java an int is a primitive while an Integer is an Object. Meaning, if you made a new Integer:</p>

<pre><code>Integer i = new Integer(6);
</code></pre>

<p>You could call some method on i:</p>

<pre><code>String s = i.toString();//sets s the string representation of i
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas with an int:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 6;
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:</p>

<pre><code>String s = i.toString();//will not work!!!
</code></pre>

<p>would produce an error, because int is not an object.</p>

<p>int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).</p>

<p>I know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>That actually sounds like IIS's <code>Low</code> level. If it is, then you won't be able to write to any file, not just the web.config.</p>

<p>Here are the levels from IIS's help file:</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Full (internal) - Specifies unrestricted permissions. Grants the ASP.NET application permissions to access any resource that is subject to operating system security. All privileged operations are supported.
</li>

<li>High (web_hightrust.config) - Specifies a high level of code access security, which means that the application cannot do any one of the following things by default:
<ul>
  <li>Call unmanaged code.</li>
  <li>Call serviced components.</li>
  <li>Write to the event log.</li>
  <li>Access Message Queuing service queues.</li>
  <li>Access ODBC, OleDb, or Oracle data sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medium (web_mediumtrust.config) - Specifies a medium level of code access security, which means that, in addition to High Trust Level restrictions, the ASP.NET application cannot do any of the following things by default:
<ul>
<li>Access files outside the application directory.</li>
<li>Access the registry.</li>
<li>Make network or Web service calls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low (web_lowtrust.config) - Specifies a low level of code access security, which means that, in addition to Medium Trust Level restrictions, the application cannot do any of the following things by default:
<ul>
<li>Write to the file system.</li>
<li>Call the Assert method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Minimal (web_minimaltrust.config) - Specifies a minimal level of code access security, which means that the application has only execute permissions.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I would suggest that if you are dead set on having an installer, have it create a <code>web.config</code> in memory that the user can save locally and <code>FTP</code> up afterward.</p>

<p>In C#, int is just an <strong><em>alias</em></strong> for <code>System.Int32</code>, string for <code>System.String</code>, double for <code>System.Double</code> etc...</p>

<p>Personally I prefer int, string, double, etc. because they don't require a <code>using System;</code> statement :) A silly reason, I know...</p>

<p>For my projects I alternate between SQL Compare from REd Gate and the Database Publishing Wizard from Microsoft which you can download free
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=56E5B1C5-BF17-42E0-A410-371A838E570A&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Wizard isn't as slick as SQL Compare or SQL Data Compare but it does the trick. One issue is that the scripts it generates may need some rearranging and/or editing to flow in one shot.</p>

<p>On the up side, it can move your schema and data which isn't bad for a free tool.</p>
<p>I've taken to hand-coding all of my DDL (creates/alter/delete) statements, adding them to my .sln as text files, and using normal versioning (using subversion, but any revision control should work). This way, I not only get the benefit of versioning, but updating live from dev/stage is the same process for code and database - tags, branches and so on work all the same.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I agree redgate is expensive if you don't have a company buying it for you. If you can get a company to buy it for you though, it really is worth it!</p>
<p>Interesting question!</p>

<p>I would do this by picking combinations, something like the following in python.  The hardest part is probably first pass verification, i.e. <code>if f(1,2,3) returns true</code>, is that a correct result?  Once you have verified that, then this is a good basis for regression testing.</p>

<p>Probably it's a good idea to make a set of test cases that you know will be all true (e.g. 3,4,5 for this triangle case), and a set of test cases that you know will be all false (e.g. 0,1,inf).  Then you can more easily verify the tests are correct.</p>

<pre>
# xpermutations from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/190465

lengths=[-1,0,1,5,10,0,1000,'inf']

    print c
</pre>

<p>If you have a company buying it, Toad from Quest Software has this kind of management functionality built in.  It's basically a two-click operation to compare two schemas and generate a sync script from one to the other.</p>

<p>They have editions for most of the popular databases, including of course Sql Server.</p>
<p>I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control.  In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).</li>
<li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li>
<li>Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB.</p>
<p>There are three ways to iterate over a result set.  The best way in terms of both
readability and performance is usually to use the built-in cursor iterator.</p>

<pre>curs.execute('select * from people')
for row in curs:
    print row
</pre>

<p>You can fetch all the rows into a list, but this can have some bad
side effects if the result set is large.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to
your client process.</p></li>
<li><p>You may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold
the built-up list.</p></li>
<li><p>It may take a while for Python to construct and deconstruct the
list which you are going to immediately discard anyways.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre>for row in curs.fetchall():
    print row
</pre>

<p>Finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at 
a time.  In general, there's no particular advantage in doing this over
using the iterator.  If there is something in your programming logic
that seems to indicate there is an advantage in doing this, perhaps
you should reconsider your programming logic.</p>

<p></p><pre>row = curs.fetchone()
while row:
    print row
    row = curs.fetchone()<pre></pre></pre>
<p>I agree that scripting everything is the best way to go and is what I advocate at work.  You should script everything from DB and object creation to populating your lookup tables.</p>

<p>Anything you do in UI only won't translate (especially for changes... not so much for first deployments) and will end up requiring a tools like what Redgate offers.</p>
<p>Confirm that you have the correct email address before sending out emails. If someone gives the wrong email address on sign-up, beat them over the head about it ASAP.</p>

<p>Always include clear "how to unsubscribe" information in EVERY email. Do not require the user to login to unsubscribe, it should be a unique url for 1-click unsubscribe.</p>

<p>This will prevent people from marking your mails as spam because "unsubscribing" is too hard.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to dump the database as necessary and backup those files.</p>

<p>Depending on your development platform, there may be opensource plugins available. Rolling your own code to do it is usually fairly trivial.</p>

<p>Note: You may want to backup the database dump instead of putting it into version control.  The files can get huge fast in version control, and cause your entire source control system to become slow (I'm recalling a CVS horror story at the moment).</p>
<p>This is a pretty good write-up of one guys experience of creating 30-day persistent sessions.</p>

<p>WARNING: blog post is from 2006</p>

<p><a href="http://grahamglass.blogs.com/main/2006/05/rails%5Fsessionsr.html" rel="nofollow">http://grahamglass.blogs.com/main/2006/05/rails_sessionsr.html</a></p>

<p>For C++, <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/random/">Boost.Random</a> is probably what you're looking for. It has support for MT (among many other algorithms), and can collect entropy via the <code>nondet_random</code> class. Check it out! :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">The Gnu Scientific Library</a> (GSL) has a pretty extensive set of RN generators, test harness, etc.  If you're on linux, it's probably already available on your system.</p>
<p>Hmm, ok.  I'd suggest code like this, then:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {<br>    int type;<br>    int result;<br>} DialogData;<br><br>static gboolean<br>display_dialog(gpointer user_data)<br>{<br>    DialogData *dialog_data = user_data;<br>    GtkWidget *dialog;<br><br>    if (dialog_data-&gt;type &amp; MB_YESNO)<br>        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(...);<br>    else<br>        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(...);<br><br>    // Set title, etc.<br><br>    dialog_data-&gt;result = gtk_dialog_run(...);<br><br>    gtk_main_quit();  // Quits the main loop run in MessageBox()<br><br>    return FALSE;<br>}<br><br>int MessageBox(...)<br>{<br>    DialogData dialog_data;<br><br>    dialog_data.type = type;<br><br>    gtk_idle_add(display_dialog, &amp;dialog_data);<br><br>    gtk_main();<br><br>    // Do stuff based on dialog_data.result<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>The struct is because you need to pass around a couple pieces of data.  The <code>gtk_idle_add()</code> call adds a method to be run when the main loop is running and idle, and the <code>FALSE</code> return value from the <code>display_dialog()</code> call means that it's only run once.  After we get the result from the dialog, we quit the main loop.  That'll cause the <code>gtk_main()</code> in your main <code>MessageBox()</code> method to return, and you'll be able to access the result from there.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>I'll add to the excellent answers given above, and talk about boxing and unboxing, and how this applies to Java (although C# has it too). I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more <em>au fait</em> with that.</p>

<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>

<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>

<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(n);<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return queue.remove();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>

<pre><code>Deque queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>I'm not a PHP dev but Google says that PHP 5+ can instantiate COM components. If you can install Outlook on a box you could write a PHP web service around the COM component to handle the requests you need. </p>

<pre><code>$outlook = COM("Outlook.Application")<br></code></pre>

<p>It's been awhile since I used FCGI but I think a FCGI process could throw a SystemExit if the thread was taking too long.  This could be the web service not responding or even a slow DNS query.  Some google results show a similar error with Python and FCGI so moving to mongrel would be a good idea.  <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/2006/06/19/time-for-a-grown-up-server-rails-mongrel-apache-capistrano-and-you/" rel="nofollow">This post</a> is my reference I used to setup mongrel and I still refer back to it.</p>

<a href="http://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/six.html">Resource for my statement</a></p>

<p>I found <a href="http://raulparolari.com/Ruby2/lambda_Proc">this page</a> which shows what the difference between Proc.new and lambda are.  According to the page, the only difference is that a lambda is strict about the number of arguments it accepts, whereas Proc.new converts missing arguments to nil.  Here is an example IRB session illustrating the difference:</p>

<pre>irb(main):001:0> l = lambda { |x, y| x + y }
=> #&lt;Proc:0x00007fc605ec0748@(irb):1&gt;
irb(main):002:0> p = Proc.new { |x, y| x + y }
=> #&lt;Proc:0x00007fc605ea8698@(irb):2&gt;
irb(main):003:0> l.call "hello", "world"
=> "helloworld"
irb(main):004:0> p.call "hello", "world"
=> "helloworld"
irb(main):005:0> l.call "hello"
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
    from (irb):1
    from (irb):5:in `call'
    from (irb):5
    from :0
irb(main):006:0> p.call "hello"
TypeError: can't convert nil into String
    from (irb):2:in `+'
    from (irb):2
    from (irb):6:in `call'
    from (irb):6
    from :0</pre>

<p>The page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior.  I agree with this sentiment.  Using a lambda seems a tad more concise, and with such an insignificant difference, it seems the better choice in the average situation.</p>

<p>As for Ruby 1.9, sorry, I haven't looked into 1.9 yet, but I don't imagine they would change it all that much (don't take my word for it though, it seems you have heard of some changes, so I am probably wrong there).</p>

<p>I have not used PHP to do this but have experience in using C# to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>The Outlook API is a way of automating Outlook rather than connecting to Exchange directly. I have previously taken this approach in a C# application and it does work although can be buggy.</p>

<p>If you wish to connect directly to the Exchange server you will need to research extended MAPI.</p>

<p>In the past I used this wrapper <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/CMapiEx.aspx">MAPIEx: Extended MAPI Wrapper</a>.</p>

<p>It is a C# project but I believe you can use some .NET code on a PHP5 Windows server. Alternatively it has a C++ core DLL that you may be a able to use. I have found it to be very good and there are some good example applications.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Sorry for the delay no current way to keep track of posts yet.</p>

<p>I do agree adding more layer on to your application and relying on 3rd party code can be scary (and rightfully so.)</p>

<p>Today I read another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4508/mapi-and-managed-code-experiences">interesting post</a> tagged up as MAPI that is on a different subject. The key thing here though is that it has linked to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mstehle/archive/2007/10/03/fyi-why-are-mapi-and-cdo-1-21-not-supported-in-managed-net-code.aspx">this important MS article</a>. I have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed code to interface to MAPI although the C++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged. </p>

<p>This blog entry also suggests other ways to connect to MAPI/Exchange server. In this case due to these new facts <a href="http://us3.php.net/imap">http://us3.php.net/imap</a> may be the answer as suggested by the other user.</p>

<p>I write a SOAP server that receives XML requests, and creates XML responses.  (Unfortunately, it's not my project, so it's closed source, but that's another problem).</p>

<p>It turned out for me that creating (SOAP) XML documents is fairly simple, if you have a data structure that "fits" the schema.</p>

<p>I keep the envelope, since the response envelope is (almost) the same as the request envelope.  Then, since my data structure is a (possibly nested) dictionary, I create a string that turns this dictionary into &lt;key>value&lt;/key> items.  </p>

<p>This is a task that recursion makes simple, and I end up with the right structure.  This is all done in python code, and is currently fast enough for production use.</p>

<p>You can also (relatively) easily build lists as well, although depending upon your client, you may hit problems unless you give length hints.</p>

<p>For me, this was much simpler, since a dictionary is a much easier way of working than some custom class.  For the books, generating XML is much easier than parsing!</p>
<p>With the "Built in" stuff, you can't, as using 1.0.* or 1.0.0.* will replace the revision and build numbers with a coded date/timestamp, which is usually also a good way. </p>

<p>For more info, see the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c405shex%28vs.80%29.aspx">Assembly Linker</a> Documentation in the /v tag.</p>

<p>As for automatically incrementing numbers, use the AssemblyInfo Task:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/AssemblyInfoTaskvers">AssemblyInfo Task</a></p>

<p>This can be configured to automatically increment the build number.</p>

<p>There are 2 Gotchas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each of the 4 numbers in the Version string is limited to 65535. This is a Windows Limitation and unlikely to get fixed.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msbuild/archive/2007/01/03/why-are-build-numbers-limited-to-65535.aspx">Why are build numbers limited to 65535?</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using with with Subversion requires a small change:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/archive/2006/08/29/4078.aspx">Using MSBuild to generate assembly version info at build time (including SubVersion fix)</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieving the Version number is then quite easy:</p>

<pre><code>Version v = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version;
string About = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, @"YourApp Version {0}.{1}.{2} (r{3})", v.Major, v.Minor, v.Build, v.Revision);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>And, to clarify: In .net or at least in C#, the build is actually the THIRD number, not the fourth one as some people (for example Delphi Developers who are used to Major.Minor.Release.Build) might expect.</p>

<p>In .net, it's Major.Minor.Build.Revision.</p>

<p>Second the Buildbot - Trac integration. You can find more information about the integration on the <a href="http://buildbot.net/trac/wiki/BuildbotAndTrac">Buildbot website</a>. At my previous job, we wrote and used the plugin they mention (tracbb).
What the plugin does is rewriting all of the Buildbot urls so you can use Buildbot from within Trac. (http://example.com/tracbb).</p>

<p>The really nice thing about Buildbot is that the configuration is written in Python. You can integrate your own Python code directly to the configuration. It's also very easy to write your own BuildSteps to execute specific tasks.</p>

<p>We used BuildSteps to get the source from SVN, pull the dependencies, publish test results to WebDAV, etcetera.</p>

<p>I wrote an X10 interface so we could send signals with build results. When the build failed, we switched on a red lava lamp. When the build succeeded, a green lava lamp switched on. Good times :-)</p>
<p>I think you should go for solution 2. There is no 'swap' function in any SQL variant I know of.</p>

<p>If you need to do this regularly, I suggest solution 1, depending on how other parts of the software are using this data. You can have locking issues if you're not careful.</p>

<p>But in short: there is no other solution than the ones you provided.</p>
<p>It depends on what kind of application you are building. Create a representative test scenario, and start hammering away. Then you will know the definitive answer.</p>

<p>Besides your use case, it also depends on CPU, memory, front-side bus, operating system, cache settings, etcetera.</p>

<p>Seriously, just test your own scenario.</p>

<p>If you are choosing an encryption method for your login system then speed is not your friend, Jeff had a to-and-frow with Thomas Ptacek about passwords and the <a href="http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2007/9/7/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-s.html">conclusion</a> was that you should use the slowest, most secure encryption method you can afford to. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From Thomas Ptacek's blog:<br>
  Speed is exactly what you don’t want in a password hash function.</p>
  
  <p>Modern password schemes are attacked with incremental password crackers.</p>
  
  <p>Incremental crackers don’t precalculate all possible cracked passwords. They consider each password hash individually, and they feed their dictionary through the password hash function the same way your PHP login page would. Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute.</p>
  
  <p>The password attack game is scored in time taken to crack password X. With rainbow tables, that time depends on how big your table needs to be and how fast you can search it. With incremental crackers, the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run.</p>
  
  <p>The better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is. MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast. MD5, SHA1, and DES are weak password hashes. On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast. Game-over FPGA implementations cost only hundreds of dollars. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is a little academic and off topic but <code>hX</code> tags are probably not the best choice for a tag cloud for reasons of document structure and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Maybe <code>span</code>s or an <code>ol</code> with appropriate class attributes (plus some CSS)?</p>

<p>I would use Javascript to submit the form. The function would be triggered by the OnKeyPress event of the form element, and would detect whether the Enter key was selected. If this is the case, it will submit the form.</p>

<p>Here are two pages that give techniques on how to do this: <a href="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/forms/index_famsupp_157.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/JavaScript/Form-Control/SubmitaformViaEnter.htm">2</a>. Based on these, here is an example of usage (based on <a href="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/forms/index_famsupp_157.html">here</a>):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!--<br>function submitenter(myfield,e) {<br>  var keycode;<br>  if (window.event) {<br>    keycode = window.event.keyCode;<br>  } else if (e) { <br>    keycode = e.which;<br>  } else {<br>    return true;<br>  }<br><br>  if (keycode == 13) {<br>    myfield.form.submit();<br>    return false;<br>  } else {<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>}<br>//--&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;<br><br>&lt;INPUT NAME="MyText" TYPE="Text" onKeyPress="return submitenter(this,event)" /&gt;<br></code></pre>
<p>The main problem with PHP sessions and security (besides session hijacking) comes with what environment you are in. By default PHP stores the session data in a file in the OS's temp directory. Without any special thought or planning this is a world readable directory so all of your session information is public to anyone with access to the server.</p>

<p>As for maintaining sessions over multiple servers. At that point it would be better to switch PHP to user handled sessions where it calls your provided functions to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) the session data. At that point you could store the session information in a database or memcache like solution so that all application servers have access to the data.</p>

<p>Storing your own sessions may also be advantageous if you are on a shared server because it will let you store it in the database which you often times have more control over then the filesystem.</p>
<p>I also think that #2 is the best bet, though I would be sure to wrap it in a transaction in case something goes wrong mid-update.</p>

<p>An alternative (since you asked) to updating the Unique Index values with different values would be to update all of the other values in the rows to that of the other row. Doing this means that you could leave the Unique Index values alone, and in the end, you end up with the data that you want. Be careful though, in case some other table references this table in a Foreign Key relationship, that all of the relationships in the DB remain intact.</p>
<p>I'm with Peter. Developer don't seem to understand passwords. We all pick (and I'm guilty of this too) MD5 or SHA1 because they are fast. Thinking about it ('cuz someone recently pointed it out to me) that doesn't make any sense. We should be picking a hashing algorithm that's stupid slow. I mean, on the scale of things, a busy site will hash passwords what? every 1/2 minute? Who cares if it take 0.8 seconds vs 0.03 seconds server wise? But that extra slowness is huge to prevent all types of common brute-forcish attacks.</p>

<p>From my reading, bcrypt is specifically designed for secure password hashing. It's based on blowfish, and there are many implementation.</p>

<p>I've found that using the recipients real first and last name in the body is a sure fire way of getting through a spam filter.</p>
<p>How often do you need to check for changes and how large (in terms of row size) are the tables in the database?  If you use the <code>CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*))</code> method suggested by John, it will scan every row of the specified table.  The <code>NOLOCK</code> hint helps, but on a large database, you are still hitting every row.  You will also need to store the checksum for every row so that you tell one has changed.</p>

<p>Have you considered going at this from a different angle?  If you do not want to modify the schema to add triggers, (which makes a sense, it's not your database), have you considered working with the application vendor that does make the database?  </p>

<p>They could implement an API that provides a mechanism for notifying accessory apps that data has changed.  It could be as simple as writing to a notification table that lists what table and which row were modified.  That could be implemented through triggers or application code.  From your side, ti wouldn't matter, your only concern would be scanning the notification table on a periodic basis.  The performance hit on the database would be far less than scanning every row for changes.</p>

<p>The hard part would be convincing the application vendor to implement this feature.  Since this can be handles entirely through SQL via triggers, you could do the bulk of the work for them by writing and testing the triggers and then bringing the code to the application vendor.  By having the vendor support the triggers, it prevent the situation where your adding a trigger inadvertently replaces a trigger supplied by the vendor.</p>

<p>The following works for me in Firefox and Internet Explorer:</p>

<p>No, you were not dreaming.  Python has a pretty excellent list comprehension system that lets you manipulate lists pretty elegantly, and depending on exactly what you want to accomplish, this can be done a couple of ways.  In essence, what you're doing is saying "For item in list if criteria.matches", and from that you can just iterate through the results or dump the results into a new list.</p>

<p>I'm going to crib an example from <a href="http://diveintopython.net/functional_programming/filtering_lists.html" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> here, because it's pretty elegant and they're smarter than I am.  Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>    files = os.listdir(path)                               
    test = re.compile("test\.py$", re.IGNORECASE)          
    files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.</p>

<p>Scott Hanselman had a good Podcast about this, entitled:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The Past, Present and Future of .NET Unit Testing Frameworks"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=130" rel="nofollow">Hanselminutes #112</a></p>

<p>I think <code>NUnit</code> <strong>is</strong> your best bet. With <code>TestDriven.NET</code>, you get great integration within <code>VS.NET</code>. (Resharper also has a unit test runner if you're using it).  <code>NUnit</code> it simple to use and follows an established paradigm. You'll also find plenty of projects/tutorials/guides using it which always helps.</p>

<p>Your other main choice is probably MBUnit, which is more and more position itself as the <code>BDD</code> framework of choice (in conjunction with Gallio <a href="http://www.gallio.org">http://www.gallio.org</a>).</p>

<p><code>Visual Studio 2008</code> has a built in test project type that works in a similar way to NUnit, but obviously has much tighter integration with <code>Visual Studio</code> (can run on every build and shows the results in a similar way to the conversion results page when upgrading solution files), but it is obviously not as mature as NUnit as it's pretty new and I'm not sure about how it handles mocking.</p>

<p>But it would be worth looking into when your team moves to <code>VS2008</code></p>

<p>Another important but subtle difference is in the way procs created with <code>lambda</code> and procs created with <code>Proc.new</code> handle the <code>return</code> statement:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a <code>lambda</code>-created proc, the <code>return</code> statement returns only from the proc itself</li>
<li>In a <code>Proc.new</code>-created proc, the <code>return</code> statement is a little more surprising: it returns control not just from the proc, <strong>but also from the method enclosing the proc!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's <code>lambda</code>-created proc's <code>return</code> in action. It behaves in a way that you probably expect:</p>

<pre><code>def whowouldwin<br><br>  mylambda = lambda {return "Freddy"}<br>  mylambda.call<br><br>  # mylambda gets called and returns "Freddy", and execution<br>  # continues on the next line<br><br>  return "Jason"<br><br>end<br><br><br>whowouldwin<br>=&gt; "Jason"<br></code></pre>

<p>Now here's a <code>Proc.new</code>-created proc's <code>return</code> doing the same thing. You're about to see one of those cases where Ruby breaks the much-vaunted Principle of Least Surprise:</p>

<pre><code>def whowouldwin2<br><br>  myproc = Proc.new {return "Freddy"}<br>  myproc.call<br><br>  # myproc gets called and returns "Freddy", <br>  # but also returns control from whowhouldwin2!<br>  # The line below *never* gets executed.<br><br>  return "Jason"<br><br>end<br><br><br>whowouldwin2         <br>=&gt; "Freddy"<br></code></pre>

<p>Thanks to this surprising behaviour (as well as less typing), I tend to favour using <code>lambda</code> over <code>Proc.new</code> when making procs. </p>
<P>It sounds like you've covered all the server-side bases--maybe it's a client issue? I assume your users have integrated authentication enabled in IE7? (Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Security). This is enabled by default.</P>
<P>Also, is your site correctly recognized by IE7 as being in the Local Intranet zone? The IE7 default is to allow automatic logon only in that zone, so users would be prompted if IE thinks your site is on the internet. I believe using a hostname with a dot in it causes IE to place the site into the Internet zone.</P>
<p>Why not use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/editions/express/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">SQL Server 2005 Express edition</a>? </p>

<p>It really depends on what you mean by "embedded" - but you can redistribute SQLServer2005E with your applications and the user never has to know it's there.</p>

<p>I think:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>bar in dict(Foo)<br></code></pre>

<p>Is what you are thinking of.  When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>

<p>That should answer your question.</p>

<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:</p>

<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])<br></code></pre>

<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement<strong>, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.</strong>  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk" rel="nofollow">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p>
<p>It sounds like ADO/Access is perfect for your needs. It's baked into the MS stack, well seasoned, and multi-user.</p>

<p>You can programatically create a DB like so:</p>

<pre><code>Dim catalog as New ADOX.Catalog<br>Catalog.Create("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=\\server\path\to\db.mdb")<br></code></pre>

<p>You can then use standard ADO.NET methods to interact with the database.</p>
<p>Are you looking to get a list of objects that have a certain attribute? If so, a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000">list comprehension</a> is the right way to do this.</p>

<pre><code>result = [obj for obj in listOfObjs if hasattr(obj, 'attributeName')]<br></code></pre>
<p>Here is a simple static method to do this in C#:</p>

<pre><code>public static string ToTitleCaseInvariant(string targetString)<br>{<br>    return System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ToTitleCase(targetString);<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>In what language?</p>

<p>In PHP it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ucwords.php" rel="nofollow">ucwords()</a></p>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>$HelloWorld = ucwords('hello world');
</code></pre>

<p>What I was thinking of can be achieved using list comprehensions, but I thought that there was a function that did this in a slightly neater way.</p>

<p>i.e. 'bar' is a list of objects, all of which have the attribute 'id'</p>

<p>The mythical functional way:</p>

<pre><code>foo = 12<br>foo in iter_attr(bar, 'id')</code></pre>

<p>The list comprehension way:</p>

<pre><code>foo = 12<br>foo in [obj.id for obj in bar]</code></pre>

<p>In retrospect the list comprehension way is pretty neat anyway.</p>
<p>Without using a ready-made function, a super-simple low-level algorithm to convert a string to title case:</p>

<p></p><pre><code>convert first character to uppercase.<br>for each character in string,<br>    if the previous character is whitespace,<br>        convert character to uppercase.<br></code></pre><code></code><p></p>

<p>This asssumes the "convert character to uppercase" will do that correctly regardless of whether or not the character is case-sensitive (e.g., '+').</p>
<p>One implementation of this problem is to attempt to call the parameter-less constructor of the Type:</p>

<pre><code>public static object GetNewObject(Type t)
{
    try
    {
        return t.GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new object[] { });
    }
    catch
    {
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the same approach, contained in a generic method:</p>

<pre><code>public static T GetNewObject&lt;T&gt;()
{
    try
    {
        return (T)typeof(T).GetConstructor(new Type[] { }).Invoke(new object[] { });
    }
    catch
    {
        return default(T);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the language you are using has a supported method/function then just use that (as in the C# <code>ToTitleCase</code> method)</p>

<p>If it does not, then you will want to do something like the following:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Read in the string  </li>
<li>Take the first word  </li>
<li>Capitalize the first letter of that word <sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Go forward and find the next word  </li>
<li>Go to 3 if not at the end of the string, otherwise exit  </li>
</ol>

<p><sup>1</sup> To capitalize it in, say, C - use the <a href="http://www.asciitable.com" rel="nofollow">ascii codes</a> to find the integer value of the char and subtract 32 from it.</p>

<p>There would need to be much more error checking in the code (ensuring valid letters etc.), and the "Capitalize" function will need to impose some sort of "title-case scheme" on the letters to check for words that do not need to be capatilised ('and', 'but' etc. <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=349913" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a good scheme)</p>

<p>The <code>Activator</code> class within the root <code>System</code> namespace is pretty powerful.</p>

<p>There are a lot of overloads for passing parameters to the constructor and such. Check out the documentation at: </p>

<blockquote>

<P>No, there are many applications built with VS2005 that have to support Windows XP, 2000, NT, the whole stack. The issue is that (by default) VS2005 wants to use libraries/exports not present on NT.</P>
<P>See <A href="http://www.mombu.com/microsoft/windows-programmer-win32/t-vs2005-and-nt4-392831.html">this thread</A> for some background.</P>
<P>Then start limiting your dependencies via preprocessor macros, and avoiding APIs which aren't supported on NT.</P>
<p>Here is my current method. Any suggestions?</p>

<pre><code>Regex singleMToDoubleRegex = new Regex("(?&lt;!m)m(?!m)");<br>Regex singleDToDoubleRegex = new Regex("(?&lt;!d)d(?!d)");<br>CultureInfo currentCulture = CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture;<br><br>// If the culture is netural there is no date pattern to use, so use the default.<br>if (currentCulture.IsNeutralCulture)<br>{<br>    currentCulture = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;<br>}<br><br>// Massage the format into a more general user friendly form.<br>string shortDatePattern = CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.DateTimeFormat.ShortDatePattern.ToLower();<br>shortDatePattern = singleMToDoubleRegex.Replace(shortDatePattern, "mm");<br>shortDatePattern = singleDToDoubleRegex.Replace(shortDatePattern, "dd");<br></code></pre>
<p>How about giving the format (mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy) followed by a printout of today's date in the user's culture. MSDN has an article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5hh873ya%28VS.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">formatting a DateTime for the person's culture</a>, using the CultureInfo object that might be helpful in doing this. A combination of the format (which most people are familiar with) combined with the current date represented in that format should be enough of a clue to the person on how they should enter the date. (Also include a calendar control for those who still cant figure it out).</p>
<p>Sounds to me like you're trying to combine things that shouldn't be combined.  If you need to do different processing in your view depending on if it's a User or Group object you're trying to look at then you should use two different view functions.</p>

<p>On the other hand there can be common idioms you'd want to extract out of your object_detail type views... perhaps you could use a decorator or just helper functions?</p>

<p>You can print from the command line using the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rundll32.exe
  %WINDIR%\System32\mshtml.dll,PrintHTML
  "%1"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where %1 is the file path of the html file to be printed.</p>

<p>If you don't need to print from memory (or can afford to write to the disk in a temp file) you can use:</p>

<pre><code>using (Process printProcess = new Process())<br>{<br>    string systemPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.System);<br>    printProcess.StartInfo.FileName = systemPath + @"\rundll32.exe";<br>    printProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = systemPath + @"\mshtml.dll,PrintHTML """ + fileToPrint + @"""";<br>    printProcess.Start();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Are you looking for a software package that'll do the work or actually doing the matrix operations and such and do each step?</p>

<p>The the first, a coworker of mine just used <a href="http://ocaml-glpk.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow" title="Ocaml GLPK">Ocaml GLPK</a>. It is just a wrapper for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/" rel="nofollow" title="GNU Linear Programming Kit">GLPK</a>, but it removes a lot of the steps of setting things up. It looks like you're going to have to stick with the GLPK, in C, though. For the latter, thanks to delicious for saving an old article I used to learn LP awhile back, <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/%7Etom/LP.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="Linear Programming">PDF</a>. If you need specific help setting up further, let us know and I'm sure, me or someone will wander back in and help, but, I think it's fairly straight forward from here. Good Luck! </p>
<p>I don't have any experience with <a href="http://www.SiteGround.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.SiteGround.com</a> as a web host personally.  </p>

<p>This is just a guess, but it's common for a shared host to support Python and MySQL with the MySQLdb module (e.g., GoDaddy does this).  Try the following CGI script to see if MySQLdb is installed.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python<br><br>module_name = 'MySQLdb'<br>head = '''Content-Type: text/html<br><br>%s is ''' % module_name<br><br>try:<br>    __import__(module_name)<br>    print head + 'installed'<br>except ImportError:<br>    print head + 'not installed'<br></code></pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramers_rule">Cramer's Rule</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Gaussian Elimination</a>
are two good, general-purpose algorithms (also see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_linear_equations">Simultaneous Linear Equations</a>). If you're looking for code, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiNaC">GiNaC</a>, <a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/">Maxima</a>, and <a href="http://issc.uj.ac.za/symbolic/symbolic.html">SymbolicC++</a> (depending on your licensing requirements, of course).</p>

<p>EDIT: I know you're working in C land, but I also have to put in a good word for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/">SymPy</a> (a  computer algebra system in Python). You can learn a lot from its algorithms (if you can read a bit of python). Also, it's under the new BSD license, while most of the free math packages are GPL.</p>
<p>Can you show us your code?</p>

<p>The example on the Python docs is quite straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
    groups.append(list(g))      # Store group iterator as a list
    uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>

<p>So in your case, data is a list of nodes, keyfunc is where the logic of your criteria function goes and then <code>groupby()</code> groups the data.</p>

<p>You must be careful to <strong>sort the data</strong> by the criteria before you call <code>groupby</code> or it won't work. <code>groupby</code> method actually just iterates through a list and whenever the key changes it creates a new group.</p>

<p>What source control system are you using? </p>

<p>Almost all of them have some form of $ Id $ tag that gets expanded when the file is checked in.</p>

<p>I usually use some form of hackery to display this as the version number.</p>

<p>The other alternative is use to use the date as the build number: 080803-1448</p>
<p>Not efficient at all, but you can use a regular expression to test for prime numbers.</p>

<pre><code>/^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
</code></pre>

<p>This tests if, for a string consisting of <em>k</em> “<code>1</code>”s, <em>k</em> is <em>not prime</em> (i.e. whether the string consists of one “<code>1</code>” or any number of “<code>1</code>”s that can be expressed as an <em>n</em>-ary product).</p>

<p>Absolutely, especially dealing with lots of these permutations/combinations I can definitely see that the first pass would be an issue.</p>

<p>Interesting implementation in python, though I wrote a nice one in C and Ocaml based on "Algorithm 515" (see below). He wrote his in Fortran as it was common back then for all the "Algorithm XX" papers, well, that assembly or c. I had to re-write it and make some small improvements to work with arrays not ranges of numbers. This one does random access, I'm still working on getting some nice implementations of the ones mentioned in Knuth 4th volume fascicle 2. I'll an explanation of how this works to the reader. Though if someone is curious, I wouldn't object to writing something up.</p>

<pre><code>/** [combination c n p x]<br> * get the [x]th lexicographically ordered set of [p] elements in [n]<br> * output is in [c], and should be sizeof(int)*[p] */<br>void combination(int* c,int n,int p, int x){<br>    int i,r,k = 0;<br>    for(i=0;i&lt;p-1;i++){<br>        c[i] = (i != 0) ? c[i-1] : 0;<br>        do {<br>            c[i]++;<br>            r = choose(n-c[i],p-(i+1));<br>            k = k + r;<br>        } while(k &lt; x);<br>        k = k - r;<br>    }<br>    c[p-1] = c[p-2] + x - k;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>The most popular (==standard?) way of determining the time zone I've seen around is simply <em>asking the users themselves.</em> If your website requires subscription, this could be saved in the users' profile data. For anon users, the dates could be displayed as UTC or GMT or some such.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to be a smart aleck. It's just that sometimes some problems have finer solutions outside of any programming context.</p>

<p><code>mbUnit</code> is worth alook, it has a set of features comparable to <code>NUnit</code>, it has its own GUI, or can be integrated into <code>VS</code> if you have <code>Resharper</code>. I would also recommend <code>Rhino Mocks</code> if you are doing any sort of <code>TDD</code>.</p>

From there you should be able to use JS to ajax, set cookies, whatever. I'd probably go the cookie route myself.</p>

<p>You'll need to allow the user to change it though. We tried to use geolocation (via maxmind) to do this a while ago, and it was wrong reasonably often - enough to make it not worth doing, so we just let the user set it in their profile, and show a notice to users who haven't set theirs yet.</p>
<p>I'm partway to my solution with this entry on MSDN (don't know how I couldn't find it before).</p>

<p>User/Machine Hive<br>
Subkeys and values entered under this hive will be installed under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive when a user chooses "Just Me" or the HKEY_USERS hive or when a user chooses "Everyone" during installation.</p>

<p>First: Yes, this is something that belongs in the Application for the exact reson you specified: What happens after new user profiles are created? Sure, if you're using a domain it's possible to have some stuff put in the registry on creation, but this is not really a use case. The Application should check if there are seetings and use the default settings if not.</p>

<p>That being said, it IS possible to change other users Keys through the HKEY_USERS Hive.</p>

<p>I have no experience with the Visual Studio 2003 Setup Project, so here is a bit of (totally unrelated) VBScript code that might just give you an idea where to look:</p>

<pre><code>const HKEY_USERS = &amp;H80000003<br>strComputer = "."<br>Set objReg=GetObject("winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" &amp; strComputer &amp; "\root\default:StdRegProv")<br>strKeyPath = ""<br>objReg.EnumKey HKEY_USERS, strKeyPath, arrSubKeys<br>strKeyPath = "\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WinTrust\Trust Providers\Software Publishing"<br>For Each subkey In arrSubKeys<br>    objReg.SetDWORDValue HKEY_USERS, subkey &amp; strKeyPath, "State", 146944<br>Next<br></code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing that because you want to set it for all users, that you're on some kind of shared computer, which is probably running under a domain?</p>

<p><strong>HERE BE DRAGONS</strong></p>

<p>Let's say Joe and Jane regularly log onto the computer, then they will each have 'registries'.</p>

<p>You'll then install your app, and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under HKCU for them.</p>

<p>THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. </p>

<p>Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated.</p>

<p>The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them. It's general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry, and should create things as needed, for any registry entry, not just HKCU, anyway</p>
<p>If you are looking for a truly language agnostic solution then you will be sorely disappointed in my opinion because you'll be stuck with a for loop and some conditionals. However if you opened it up to functional languages or functional language features (I'm looking at you LINQ) then my colleagues here can fill this page with elegant examples in Ruby, Lisp, Erlang, and others.</p>
<p>Looks like a web service is going to be the answer for me. On a production box I'd rather not have to go through compiling and maintaining my own special installation of PHP since ODBC support needs to be compiled in, according to the PHP documentation.</p>

<p>A solution, albeit one that defers handling of the null value to the code, could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DateTime yesterday = DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(-1);</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>var collection=
    from u in db.Universe
    select new
    {
        u.id,
        u.name,
        MaxDate =(DateTime?)
       (
           from h in db.History
           where u.Id == h.Id
           &amp;&amp; h.dateCol &lt; yesterday
           select h.dateCol 
       ).Max()
    };
</code></pre>

<p>This does not produce exactly the same SQL, but does provide the same logical result. Translating "complex" SQL queries to LINQ is not always straightforward.</p>

<p>If you expect infrequent collisions, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa0416cz.aspx" rel="nofollow">Optimistic Concurrency</a> is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>The best I could come up with is to produce a matrix of sums of each pair, and then merge the rows together, a-la merge sort.  I feel like I'm missing some simple insight that will reveal a much more efficient solution.</p>

<p>My algorithm, in Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>matrixOfSums list = [[a+b | b &lt;- list, b &gt;= a] | a &lt;- list]<br><br>sortedSums = foldl merge [] matrixOfSums<br><br>--A normal merge, save that we remove duplicates<br>merge xs [] = xs<br>merge [] ys = ys<br>merge (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of<br>    LT -&gt; x:(merge xs (y:ys))<br>    EQ -&gt; x:(merge xs (dropWhile (==x) ys))<br>    GT -&gt; y:(merge (x:xs) ys)<br></code></pre>

<p>I found a minor improvement, one that's more amenable to lazy stream-based coding.  Instead of merging the columns pair-wise, merge all of them at once.  The advantage being that you start getting elements of the list immediately.</p>

<pre><code>-- wide-merge does a standard merge (ala merge-sort) across an arbitrary number of lists<br>-- wideNubMerge does this while eliminating duplicates<br>wideNubMerge :: Ord a =&gt; [[a]] -&gt; [a]<br>wideNubMerge ls = wideNubMerge1 $ filter (/= []) ls<br>wideNubMerge1 [] = []<br>wideNubMerge1 ls = mini:(wideNubMerge rest)<br>    where mini = minimum $ map head ls<br>          rest = map (dropWhile (== mini)) ls<br><br>betterSortedSums = wideNubMerge matrixOfSums<br></code></pre>

<p>However, if you know you're going to use all of the sums, and there's no advantage to getting some of them earlier, go with '<code>foldl merge []</code>', as it's faster.</p>
<p>I've seen it done in a kind of iffy, but pretty reliable way.  Basically, an element is set to use a specific font and a string is set to that element.  If the font set for the element does not exist, it takes the font of the parent element.  So, what they do is measure the width of the rendered string.  If it matches what they expected for the desired font as opposed to the derived font, it's present.</p>

<p>Despite what the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x6kd89c5%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN article</a>  says about User/Machine Hive, it doesn't write to HKEY_USERS. Rather it writes to HKCU if you select Just Me and HKLM if you select Everyone.</p>

<p>So my solution is going to be to use the User/Machine Hive, and then in the application it checks if the registry entries are in HKCU and if not, copies them from HKLM. I know this probably isn't the most ideal way of doing it, but it has the least amount of changes.</p>

<p>Git is not better than Subversion. But is also not worse. It's different.</p>

<p>The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.</p>

<p>With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.</p>

<p>With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.</p>

<p>This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach.</p>

<p>Git seems to be the "new, shiny, cool" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the "Distributed Source Control" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better.</p>

<p>Subversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight.</p>

<p>First of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple "svnadmin create", Git's "git init" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the "proper" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the "checkout" command is very confusing to people changing over - the "proper" way seems to be "git clone", while "git checkout" seems to switch branches.</p>

<p>Git REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named "origin").</p>

<p>As said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with "the server" (I'm assuming most people still like a central "master-repository").</p>

<p>Also, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit.</p>

<p>SVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on.</p>

<p>Git has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written).</p>

<p>This also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic.</p>

<p>What I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN.</p>

<p>But even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for "Offline Source Control" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.</p>

<p>Well, it's distributed. Benchmarks indicate that it's considerably faster (given its distributed nature, operations like diffs and logs are all local so of course it's blazingly faster in this case), and working folders are smaller (which still blows my mind).</p>

<p>When you're working on subversion, or any other client/server revision control system, you essentially create working copies on your machine by <em>checking-out</em> revisions. This represents a snapshot in time of what the repository looks like. You update your working copy via updates, and you update the repository via commits.</p>

<p>With a distributed version control, you don't have a snapshot, but rather the entire codebase. Wanna do a diff with a 3 month old version? No problem, the 3 month old version is still on your computer. This doesn't only mean things are way faster, but if you're disconnected from your central server, you can still do many of the operations you're used to. In other words, you don't just have a snapshot of a given revision, but the entire codebase.</p>

<p>You'd think that Git would take up a bunch of space on your harddrive, but from a couple benchmarks I've seen, it actually takes less. Don't ask me how. I mean, it was built by Linus, he knows a thing or two about filesystems I guess.</p>

<p>You'll need to compile with the target <code>CPU</code> set to <code>x86</code> to force your code to use the <code>32 bit</code> version of the <code>VFP OLE Db provider</code>.  </p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb190293.aspx" rel="nofollow">Microsoft has stated</a> that there are no plans on releasing a <code>64-bit</code> edition of the Visual FoxPro OLE Db provider.  For what's worth, Microsoft has <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx" rel="nofollow">also stated</a> that VFP 9 is the final version of <code>Visual FoxPro</code> and support will end in <code>2015</code>.

<P>Depends on the version, 4 is by value, 5 is by reference.</P>
<p>PHP variables are assigned by value, passed to functions by value, and when containing/representing objects are passed by reference. You can force variables to pass by reference using an &amp;</p>

<p>Assigned by value/reference example:</p>

<pre><code>$var1 = "test";
$var2 = $var1;
$var2 = "new test";
$var3 = &amp;$var2;
$var3 = "final test";

print ("var1: $var1, var2: $var2, var3: $var3);
</code></pre>

<p>would output "var1: test, var2: final test, var3: final test".</p>

<p>Passed by value/reference exampe:</p>

<pre><code>$var1 = "foo";
$var2 = "bar";

changeThem($var1, $var2);

print "var1: $var1, var2: $var2";

function changeThem($var1, &amp;$var2){
    $var1 = "FOO";
    $var2 = "BAR";
}
</code></pre>

<p>would output: "var1: foo, var2 BAR".</p>

<p>Object variables passed by reference exampe:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo{
    public $var1;

    function __construct(){
        $this-&gt;var1 = "foo";
    }

    public function printFoo(){
        print $this-&gt;var1;
    }
}


$foo = new Foo();

changeFoo($foo);

$foo-&gt;printFoo();

function changeFoo($foo){
    $foo-&gt;var1 = "FOO";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Would output: "FOO"</p>

<p>(that last example could be better probably...)</p>

<p>Rather than coding this out, I figure I'll pseudo-code it in steps and explain my logic, so that better programmers can poke holes in my logic if necessary. </p>

<p>On the first step we start out with a list of numbers length n. For each number we need to create a list of length n-1 becuase we aren't adding a number to itself. By the end we have a list of about n sorted lists that was generated in O(n^2) time.</p>

<pre><code>step 1 (startinglist) 
for each number num1 in startinglist
   for each number num2 in startinglist
      add num1 plus num2 into templist
   add templist to sumlist
return sumlist 
</code></pre>

<p>In step 2 because the lists were sorted by design (add a number to each element in a sorted list and the list will still be sorted) we can simply do a mergesort by merging each list together rather than mergesorting the whole lot.  In the end this should take O(n^2) time.</p>

<pre><code>step 2 (sumlist) 
create an empty list mergedlist
for each list templist in sumlist
   set mergelist equal to: merge(mergedlist,templist)
return mergedlist
</code></pre>

<p>The merge method would be then the normal merge step with a check to make sure that there are no duplicate sums.  I won't write this out because anyone can look up mergesort.</p>

<p>So there's my solution.  The entire algorithm is O(n^2) time.  Feel free to point out any mistakes or improvements.</p>

<p>It's by value according to the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php">PHP Documentation</a>.</p>

  <p>By default, function arguments are passed by value (so that if the value of the argument within the function is changed, it does not get changed outside of the function). To allow a function to modify its arguments, they must be passed by reference.</p>
  
  <p>To have an argument to a function always passed by reference, prepend an ampersand (<strong>&amp;</strong>) to the argument name in the function definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
function add_some_extra(&amp;$string)
{
    $string .= 'and something extra.';
}

$str = 'This is a string, ';
add_some_extra($str);
echo $str;    // outputs 'This is a string, and something extra.'
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Git and DVCS in general is great for developers doing a lot of coding independently of each other because everyone has their own branch.  If you need a change from someone else, though, she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her.</p>

<p>My own reasoning also makes me think DVCS makes things harder for QA and release management if you do things like centralized releases.  Someone has to be responsible for doing that push/pull from everyone else's repository, resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before, then doing the build, and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos.</p>

<p>All of this can be addressed with human processes, of course; DVCS just broke something that was fixed by centralized version control in order to provide some new conveniences.</p>
<p>I've used the <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/studio/">Zend Studio (5.5)</a>, together with <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/platform/">Zend Platform</a>. That gives proper debugging, breakpoints/stepping over the code etc., although at a price.</p>
<p>Try <a href="https://eclipse.org/pdt/">Eclipse PDT</a> to setup an Eclipse environment that has debugging features like you mentioned. The ability to step into the code is a much better way to debug then the old method of var_dump and print at various points to see where your flow goes wrong. When all else fails though and all I have is SSH and vim I still <code>var_dump()</code>/<code>die()</code> to find where the code goes south.</p>

<pre><code>print_r( debug_backtrace() );<br></code></pre>

<p>or something like that :-)</p>
<p>It's all about the ease of use/steps required to do something.</p>

<p>If I'm developing a single project on my PC/laptop, git is better, because it is far easier to set up and use. 
You don't need a server, and you don't need to keep typing repository URL's in when you do merges.</p>

<p>If it were just 2 people, I'd say git is also easier, because you can just push and pull from eachother.</p>

<p>Once you get beyond that though, I'd go for subversion, because at that point you need to set up a 'dedicated' server or location. </p>

<p>You can do this just as well with git as with SVN, but the benefits of git get outweighed by the need to do additional steps to synch with a central server. In SVN you just commit. In git you have to git commit, then git push. The additional step gets annoying simply because you end up doing it so much.</p>

<p>SVN also has the benefit of better GUI tools, however the git ecosystem seems to be catching up quickly, so I wouldn't worry about this in the long term.</p>
<p>If you have the ability to use WScript.Shell then you can just execute pscp.exe from the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/">Putty</a> package. Obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use SCP/SFTP in classic ASP.</p>
<p>I am by no means authoritative, but I believe the only supported path is from 6.5 to 7. Certainly that would be the most sane route, then I believe you can migrate from 7 directly to 2005 pretty painlessly.</p>

<p>As for scripting out all the objects - I would advise against it as you will inevitably miss something (unless you database is truly trivial).</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In PHP 5 there is a new Object Model. PHP's handling of objects has been completely rewritten, allowing for better performance and more features. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like primitive types (for instance integers and strings). The drawback of this method was that semantically the whole object was copied when a variable was assigned, or passed as a parameter to a method. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by value (one can think of a handle as an object's identifier). </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Variables containing primitive types are passed by value in PHP5. Variables containing objects are passed by reference. There's quite an interesting article from Linux Journal from 2006 which mentions this and other OO differences between 4 and 5.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9170" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9170</a> </p>
<p>I worked on a project for my previous employer that used .NET, and there was a built in .resx format we used.  We basically had a file that had all translations in the .resx file, and then multiple files with different translations.  The consequence of this is that you have to be very diligent about ensuring that all strings visible in the application are stored in the .resx, and anytime one is changed you have to update all languages you support.</p>

<p>If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later.  Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place.  Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized.</p>

<p>One other note, very strictly avoid concatenating visible strings directly, such as</p>

<pre><code>String message = "The " + item + " is on sale!";
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, you must use something like</p>

<pre><code>String message = String.Format("The {0} is on sale!", item);
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words.</p>

<p>If you can find a professional or some other super-enterprise version of Visual Studio 6.0 - it came with a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSDE" rel="nofollow">MSDE</a> (Basically the predecessor to SQL Express). I believe MSDE 2000 is still available as a free download from Microsoft, but I don't know if you can migrate directly from 6.5 to 2000.</p>

<p>I think in concept, you won't likely face any danger. Years of practice however tell me that you will always miss some object, permission, or other database item that won't manifest itself immediately. If you can script out the entire dump, the better as you will be less likely to miss something - and if you do miss something, it can be easily added to the script and fixed. I would avoid any manual steps (other than hitting the enter key once) like the plague.</p>
<p>With Git, you can do practically anything offline, because everybody has their own repository.</p>

<p>Making branches and merging between branches is really easy.</p>

<p>Even if you don't have commit rights for a project, you can still have your own repository online, and publish "push requests" for your patches. Everybody who likes your patches can pull them into their project, including the official maintainers.</p>

<p>It's trivial to fork a project, modify it, and still keep merging in the bugfixes from the HEAD branch. </p>

<p>Git works for the Linux kernel developers. That means it is really fast (it has to be), and scales to thousands of contributors. Git also uses less space (up to 30 times less space for the Mozilla repository).</p>

<p>Git is very flexible, very TIMTOWTDI (There is more than one way to do it). You can use whatever workflow you want, and Git will support it.</p>

<p>Finally, there's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>, a great site for hosting your Git repositories.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of Git: </p>

<ul>
<li>it's much harder to learn, because Git has more concepts and more commands.</li>
<li>revisions don't have version numbers like in subversion</li>
<li>many Git commands are cryptic, and error messages are very user-unfriendly</li>
<li>it lacks a good GUI (such as the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortoiseSVN" rel="nofollow">TortoiseSVN</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of CSS3, it is not yet fully supported, <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/word-wrap/" rel="nofollow">but you can find information on word-wrapping here</a>.

<p>Some fun things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Having a PHP and MySQL Application that works well with German and French, but now needs to support Russian and Chinese. I think I move this over to .net, as PHP's Unicode support is - in my opinion - not really good. Sure, juggling around with utf8_de/encode or the mbstring-functions is fun. Almost as fun as having Freddy Krüger visit you at night...</p></li>
<li><p>Realizing that some languages are a LOT more Verbose than others. German is a LOT more verbose than English usually, and seeing how the German Version destroys the User Interface because too little space was allocated was not fun. Some products gained some fame for their creative ways to work around that, with Oblivion's "Schw.Tr.d.Le.En.W." being memorable :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Playing around with date formats, woohoo! Yes, there ARE actually people in the world who use date formats where the day goes in the middle. Sooooo much fun trying to find out what 07/02/2008 is supposed to mean, just because some users might believe it could be July 2... But then again, you guys over the pond may believe the same about users who put the month in the middle :-P, especially because in English, July 2 sounds a lot better than 2nd of July, something that does not neccessarily apply to other languages (i.e. in German, you would never say Juli 2 but always Zweiter Juli). I use 2008-02-07 whenever possible. It's clear that it means February 7 and it sorts properly, but dd/mm vs. mm/dd can be a really tricky problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Anoter fun thing, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/192/floating-point-number-parsing-is-there-a-catch-all-algorithm" rel="nofollow">Number formats</a>! 10.000,50 vs 10,000.50 vs. 10 000,50 vs. 10'000,50... This is my biggest nightmare right now, having to support a multi-cultural environent but not having any way to reliably know what number format the user will use.</p></li>
<li><p>Formal or Informal. In some language, there are two ways to address people, a formal way and a more informal way. In English, you just say "You", but in German you have to decide between the formal "Sie" and the informal "Du", same for French Tu/Vous. It's usually a safe bet to choose the formal way, but this is easily overlooked.</p></li>
<li><p>Calendars. In Europe, the first day of the Week is Monday, whereas in the US it's Sunday. Calendar Widgets are nice. Showing a Calendar with Sunday on the left and Saturday on the right to a European user is not so nice, it confuses them.</p></li>

<p>@Bernard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to admit, most of your example went straight over my head. It does compile, and seems to work, though. Is this safe for SMP systems or SpeedStep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a good question... I think the code's ok.
From a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day,
and we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores.
Of course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead
(because it doesn't make a context switch into system-space) method
of timing.</p>

<p>Generally how it works is:</p>

<ul>
<li>declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the
optimizer will leave it alone).</li>
<li>execute the CPUID instruction.  In addition to getting some CPU information
(which we don't do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU's execution buffer
so that the timings aren't affected by out-of-order execution.</li>
<li>execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution.  This fetches the number of
machine cycles executed since the processor was reset.  This is a 64-bit
value, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so.
Interestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every
5800 years or so.</li>
<li>the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into
the variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the
"cpuid" instruction which in addition to giving you some information
about the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution.</p></li>
<li><p>Most OS's synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so
the answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you
probably don't care about timings across hibernation boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed
changes and returns an adjusted count.  I did a quick scan over
some of the boxes on our network and found only one box that
didn't have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server.
(these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo)</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure about the AMD CPUs, we're primarily an Intel shop,
although I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an
AMD evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it's an interesting and (IMHO)
under-studied area of programming.  You know when Jeff and Joel were
talking about whether or not a programmer should know C?  I was
shouting at them, "hey forget that high-level C stuff... assembler
is what you should learn if you want to know what the computer is
doing!"</p>

<p>Does doubling the \ work?</p>

<pre><code>insert into EscapeTest (text) values ('This will be inserted \\n This will not be');<br></code></pre>
<p>Partially. The text is inserted, but the warning is still generated.</p>

<p>I found a discussion that indicated the text needed to be preceded with 'E', as such:</p>

<pre><code>insert into EscapeTest (text) values (E'This is the first part \n And this is the second');
</code></pre>

<p>This suppressed the warning, but the text was still not being returned correctly. When I added the additional slash as Michael suggested, it worked.</p>

<p>As such:</p>

<pre><code>insert into EscapeTest (text) values (E'This is the first part \\n And this is the second');
</code></pre>

<p>There is nothing I know of that can do this without you at least writing a little bit of code... You will need 2 separate library:</p>

<ul>
<li>A CSV Parser Framework </li>
<li>An XML Serialization Framework</li>
</ul>

<p>The CSV parser I would recommend (unless you want to have a little bit of fun to write your own CSV Parser) is OpenCSV (A SourceForge Project for parsing CSV Data)</p>

<p>The XML Serialization Framework should be something that can scale in case you want to transform large (or huge) CSV file to XML: My recommendation is the Sun Java Streaming XML Parser Framework (See <a href="https://sjsxp.java.net/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) which allows pull-parsing AND serialization.</p>

<p>Very roughly and from memory since I don't have code on this laptop:</p>

<pre><code>using (OleDBConnection conn = new OleDbConnection())
{
  conn.ConnectionString = "Whatever connection string";

  using (OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand())
  {
    cmd.Connection = conn;
    cmd.CommandText = "Select * from CoolTable";

    using (OleDbDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
    {
      while (dr.Read())
      {
        // do something like Console.WriteLine(dr["column name"] as String);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All editions of <code>SQL Server 2000/2005/2008</code> support having multiple databases, each using their own collation sequence.  You don't need the Enterprise version.  </p>

<p>When you have a database that uses a collation sequence that is different from default collation for the database server, you will need to take some extra precautions if you use temporary tables and/or table variables.  Temp tables/variables live in the tempdb database, which uses the collation seqyuence used by by the master databases.  Just remember to use "<code>COLLATE database_default</code>" when defining character fields in the temp tables/variables.  I <a href="http://anotherlab.rajapet.net/2008/07/handling-collation-sequences-with.html" rel="nofollow">blogged about that</a> not too long ago, if you want some more details.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>I also found the documentation regarding the E:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PostgreSQL also accepts "escape" string constants, which are an extension to the SQL standard. An escape string constant is specified by writing the letter E (upper or lower case) just before the opening single quote, e.g. E'foo'. (When continuing an escape string constant across lines, write E only before the first opening quote.) Within an escape string, a backslash character (\) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in which the combination of backslash and following character(s) represents a special byte value. \b is a backspace, \f is a form feed, \n is a newline, \r is a carriage return, \t is a tab. Also supported are \digits, where digits represents an octal byte value, and \xhexdigits, where hexdigits represents a hexadecimal byte value. (It is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding.) Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to include a backslash character, write two backslashes (\\). Also, a single quote can be included in an escape string by writing \', in addition to the normal way of ''.</p>

<p>You can upgrade 6.5 to SQL Server 2000.  You may have an easier time getting a hold of SQL Server or the 2000 version of the MSDE.  Microsoft has a page on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2000/deploy/sqlugrd.mspx#EQFAC" rel="nofollow">going from 6.5 to 2000</a>.  Once you have the database in 2000 format, SQL Server 2005 will have no trouble upgrading it to the 2005 format.  </p>

<p>@Goyuix -- that's excellent for something written from memory.
tested it here -- found the connection wasn't opened. Otherwise very nice.</p>

<pre><code>using System.Data.OleDb;

<p>Encoding flash video is actually very easy with ffmpeg.  You can use one command to convert from just about any video format, ffmpeg is smart enough to figure the rest out, and it'll use every processor on your machine.  Invoking it is easy:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.avi output.flv<br></code></pre>

<p>ffmpeg will guess at the bitrate you want, but if you'd like to specify one, you can use the -b option, so <code>-b 500000</code> is 500kbps for example.  There's a ton of options of course, but I generally get good results without much tinkering.  This is a good place to start if you're looking for more options: <a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg-doc.html#SEC9" rel="nofollow">video options</a>.</p>

<p>You don't need a special web server to show flash video.  I've done just fine by simply pushing .flv files up to a standard web server, and linking to them with a good swf player, like <a href="http://flowplayer.org/" rel="nofollow">flowplayer</a>.</p>

<p>WMVs are fine if you can be sure that all of your users will always use [a recent, up to date version of] Windows only, but even then, Flash is often a better fit for the web.  The player is even extremely skinnable and can be controlled with javascript.</p>
<p>The database will do this for you.  Look at "select ... for update", which is designed just for this kind of thing.  It will give you a write lock on the selected rows, which you can then commit or roll back.</p>
<p>In Python monkey patching generally works by overwriting a class or functions signature with your own. Below is an example from the <a href="http://wiki.zope.org/zope2/MonkeyPatch">Zope Wiki</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from SomeOtherProduct.SomeModule import SomeClass<br>def speak(self):<br>   return "ook ook eee eee eee!"<br>SomeClass.speak = speak<br></code></pre>

<p>That code will overwrite/create a method called speak on the class. In Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001151.html">recent post on monkey patching</a>. He shows an example in C# 3.0 which is the current language I use for work.</p>
<p>I don't know Python syntax, but I know Ruby can do it, and it is rather trivial.  Let's say you want to add a method to Array that prints the length to standard out:</p>

<pre><code>class Array<br>  def print_length<br>    puts length<br>  end<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to modify the whole class, you can just add the method to a single instance of the array, and no other arrays will have the method:</p>

<pre><code>array = [1, 2, 3]<br>def array.print_length<br>  puts length<br>end<br></code></pre>

<p>Just be aware of the issues involved in using this feature.  Jeff Atwood actually <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001151.html" rel="nofollow">wrote about it</a> not too long ago.</p>
<p>is this a console app or a winforms app? If it's a .NET 1.1 console app this is, sadly, by design -- it's confirmed by a MSFT dev in the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000216.html" rel="nofollow">second blog post you referenced</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BTW, on my 1.1 machine the example from MSDN does have the expected output; it's just that the second line doesn't show up until after you've attached a debugger (or not). In v2 we've flipped things around so that the UnhandledException event fires before the debugger attaches, which seems to be what most people expect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like .NET 2.0 does this better (thank goodness), but honestly, I never had time to go back and check.</p>
<p>It's a WinForms app. The exceptions that are caught by Application.ThreadException work fine, and I don't get the ugly .NET exception box (OK to terminate, cancel to debug? who came up with that??).</p>

<p>I was getting some exceptions that weren't being caught by that and ended up going to the AppDomain.UnhandledException event that were causing problems. I think I've caught most of those exceptions and I am displaying them in our nice error box now.</p>

<p>So I'll just have to hope there are not some other circumstances that would cause exceptions to not be caught by the Application.ThreadException handler.</p>
<p>A quick Google seems to give this advice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't try to edit if it's read-only.</li>
<li>You might be able to change the permissions on the file. (Whether or not it will let you save is up to experimentation.)</li>
<li>If you still edited anyway, save to a temporary file and then move it.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=782136" rel="nofollow">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=782136</a></p>
<p>Ryan's advice is generally good, however, if following step 3, don't move the temporary file; it'll have the wrong ownership and permissions. Instead, <code>sudoedit</code> the correct file and read in the contents (using <code>:r</code> or the like) of the temporary file.</p>

<p>If following step 2, use <code>:w!</code> to force the file to be written.</p>
<p>Oh, in WinForms you definitely should be able to get it to work. The only thing you have to watch out for is things happening on different threads.</p>

<p>I have an old CodeProject article here which should help:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/exception/ExceptionHandling.aspx">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/exception/ExceptionHandling.aspx</a></p>
<p>That's definitely a good way to do it.  But you if you happen to be using a database that supports LINQ to SQL, it can be a lot more fun.  It can look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyDB db = new MyDB("Data Source=...");<br>var q = from db.MyTable<br>        select c;<br>foreach (var c in q)<br>  Console.WriteLine(c.MyField.ToString());<br></code></pre>
<p>The CCNetArtifactDirectory is passed to the MSBuild by default, so you dont need to worry about it. MSBuild will place the build output in the "bin location" relevant to the working directory that you have specified.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;executable&gt;c:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\MSBuild.exe&lt;/executable&gt;
&lt;workingDirectory&gt;C:\data\projects\FooSolution\&lt;/workingDirectory&gt;
&lt;projectFile&gt;FooSolution.sln&lt;/projectFile&gt;
&lt;buildArgs&gt;/noconsolelogger /p:Configuration=Debug &lt;/buildArgs&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So in the above example your build output will be put in C:\data\projects\FooSolution[ProjectName]\bin\Debug. Should you want to output to a different location you may want to look at of the  tag in CCNET.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;publishers&gt;
  &lt;xmllogger /&gt;
  &lt;buildpublisher&gt;
    &lt;sourceDir&gt;C:\data\projects\FooSolution\FooProject\bin\Debug&lt;/sourceDir&gt;
    &lt;publishDir&gt;C:\published\FooSolution\&lt;/publishDir&gt;
    &lt;useLabelSubDirectory&gt;false&lt;/useLabelSubDirectory&gt;
  &lt;/buildpublisher&gt;
&lt;/publishers&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to publish your output to a different location.</p>

<p>Well, based on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682411(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> it looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Security attributes (can pass null)</li>
<li>Whether it's initially owned (can pass false)</li>
<li>The name of it</li>
</ol>

<p>HTH</p>

<p>This was caused by a change in rails 2.1 which prevents rails from loading views from any arbitrary path for security reasons.</p>

<p>To work around it, edit <code>init.rb</code> under your <code>vendor/plugins/exception_notification</code> directory, and add the following code to the end</p>

<pre><code>ActionController::Base.class_eval do
  append_view_path File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/lib/../views'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This adds the ExceptionNotifier plugins' views folder to the list, so it is allowed to load them.</p>

<p>The VB code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>hMutex = CreateMutex(ByVal 0&amp;, 1, ByVal 0&amp;)
</code></pre>

<p>The first parameter is a pointer to an <code>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</code> structure. If you don't know what it is, you don't need it. Pass NULL (0).</p>

<p>The second parameter is <code>TRUE</code> (non-zero, or 1) if the calling thread should take ownership of the mutex. <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>The third parameter is the mutex name and may be NULL (0), as shown. If you need a named mutex, pass the name (anything unique) in. Not sure whether the <code>VB</code> wrapper marshals the length-prefixed <code>VB</code> string type (<code>BSTR</code>) over to a null-terminated Ascii/Unicode string if not, you'll need to do that and numerous examples are out there.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Here's a nice free service with a public API:

<p>While I haven't used a flash object inside a windows form application myself, I do know that it's possible.
In Visual studio on your toolbox, choose to add a new component.
Then in the new window that appears choose the <strong>"COM Components"</strong> tab to get a list in which you can find the <strong>"Shockwave Flash Object"</strong></p>

<p>Once added to the toolbox, simply use the control as you would use any other "standard" control from visual studio.</p>

<p>three simple commands are available to interact with the control:</p>

<ul>
<li>AxShockwaveFlash1.Stop()</li>
<li>AxShockwaveFlash1.Movie = FilePath &amp;
"\FileName.swf"</li>
<li>AxShockwaveFlash1.Play()</li>
</ul>

<p>which, I think, are all self explanatory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be great to be able to load
  the flash content from a stream of
  sorts rather than a file on disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just saw you are also looking for a means to load the content from a stream,
and because I'm not really sure that is possible with the shockwave flash object I will give you another option (two actually).</p>

<p>the first is the one I would advise you to use only when necessary, as it uses the full blown <strong>"webbrowser component"</strong> (also available as an extra toolbox item), which is like trying to shoot a fly with a bazooka.
of course it will work, as the control will act as <a href="http://visualbasic.about.com/library/courses/blecvbsbs2202.htm">a real browser window</a> (actually the internet explorer browser), but its not really meant to be used in the way you need it.</p>

<p>the second option is to use something I just discovered while looking for more information about playing flash content inside a windows form. <a href="http://www.f-in-box.com/dotnet/#feature_flv_playing">F-IN-BOX</a> is a commercial solution that will also play content from a given website URL. (The link provided will direct you to the .NET code you have to use).</p>
<p>You can use this program, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx" rel="nofollow">Handle</a>, to find which process has the lock on your file. It's a command-line tool, so I guess you use the output from that... I'm not sure about finding it programmatically.</p>

<p>If deleting the file can wait, you could specify it for deletion when your computer next starts up:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start <code>REGEDT32 (W2K)</code> or <code>REGEDIT (WXP)</code> and navigate to:</p>

<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>W2K and WXP</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>W2K:</strong><br/>Edit<br/>Add Value...<br/>Data Type: <code>REG_MULTI_SZ</code><br/>Value Name: <code>PendingFileRenameOperations</code><br/><kbd>OK</kbd></p></li>
<li><p><strong>WXP:</strong><br/>Edit<br/>New<br/>Multi-String Value<br/><kbd>enter</kbd><br/>
<code>PendingFileRenameOperations</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In the Data area, enter <code>"\??\" + filename</code> to be deleted. LFNs may
be entered without being embedded in quotes. To delete <code>C:\Long Directory Name\Long File Name.exe</code>, enter the following data:</p>

<pre><code>\??\C:\Long Directory Name\Long File Name.exe
</code></pre>

<p>Then press <kbd>OK</kbd>.</p></li>
<li><p>The "destination file name" is a null (zero) string. It is entered
as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>W2K:</strong><br/>Edit<br/>Binary<br/>select Data Format: Hex<br/>click at the end of the hex string<br/>enter 0000 (four zeros)<br/><kbd>OK</kbd></p></li>
<li><p><strong>WXP:</strong><br/>Right-click the value<br/>choose "Modify Binary Data"<br/>click at the end of the hex string<br/>enter 0000 (four zeros)<br/><kbd>OK</kbd></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Close <code>REGEDT32/REGEDIT</code> and reboot to delete the file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Killing other processes is not a healthy thing to do. If your scenario involves something like uninstallation, you could use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365240%28VS.85%29.aspx"><strong><code>MoveFileEx</code></strong> API function</a> to mark the file for deletion upon next reboot.</p>

<p>If it appears that you really need to delete a file in use by another process, I'd recommend re-considering the actual problem before considering any solutions.</p>

<p>Quoting a much-replicated help page about Indexing Service query language:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To use specially treated characters such as &amp;, |, ^, #, @, $, (, ), in a query, enclose your query in quotation marks (“).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, full text search in <code>MSSQL</code> is also done by the Indexing Service, so this might help.</p>

<p>If you want to do it programatically. I'm not sure... and I'd really recommend against it.
If you're just troubleshooting stuff on your own machine, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">SysInternals Process Explorer</a> can help you</p>

<p>Run it, use the Find Handle command (I think it's either in the find or handle menu), and search for the name of your file. Once the handle(s) is found, you can forcibly close them.</p>

<p>You can then delete the file and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Beware</strong>, doing this may cause the program which owns the handles to behave strangely, as you've just pulled the proverbial rug out from under it, but it works well when you are debugging your own errant code, or when visual studio / windows explorer is being crap and not releasing file handles even though you told them to close the file ages ago... sigh :-)</p>
<p>Oh, one big hack I employed years ago, is that Windows won't let you <em>delete</em> files, but it does let you <em>move</em> them.</p>

<p>Pseudo-sort-of-code:</p>

<pre><code>mv %WINDIR%\System32\mfc42.dll %WINDIR\System32\mfc42.dll.old
Install new mfc42.dll
Tell user to save work and restart applications
</code></pre>

<p>When the applications restarted (note we didn't need to reboot the machine), they loaded the new <code>mfc42.dll</code>, and all was well. That, coupled with <code>PendingFileOperations</code> to delete the old one the next time the whole system restarted, worked pretty well.</p>

<P>The typical method is as follows. You've said you want to do this in C# so here goes...</P>
<OL>
<LI>If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.</LI>
<LI>Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).</LI>
<LI>That bootstrap DLL then closes the handle using CloseHandle etc.</LI></OL>
<P>Essentially: the way to unlock a "locked" file is to inject a DLL into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.</P>

<p>A lot of people (including my company) seem to use MaxMind GeoIP.</p>

<p>They have a free version <a href="http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/" rel="nofollow">GeoLite</a> which is not as accurate as the paid version, but if you're just after something simple, it may be good enough.</p>

<p>Is it possible to settle this dispute?</p>

<p>My first thought is to look to a symbolic language, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_%28software%29" rel="nofollow">Maple</a>. I don't think that counts as floating point though.</p>

<p>In fact, how does one represent <em>i</em> (or <em>j</em> for the engineers) in a conventional programming language?</p>

<p>Perhaps a better example is sin(π) = 0? (Or have I missed the point again?)</p>

<p>The # char is indexed as punctuation and therefore ignored, so it looks like we'll remove the letter C from our word indexing ignore lists.</p>

<p>Tested it locally after doing that and rebuilding the indexes and I get results!</p>

<p>Looking at using a different word breaker language on the indexed column, so that those special characters aren't ignored.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also found <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/sql-server-full-text-search-language-features/">this information</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c# is indexed as c (if c is not in your noise word list, see more on noise word lists later), but C# is indexed as C# (in SQL 2005 and SQL 2000 running on Win2003 regardless if C or c is in your noise word list). It is not only C# that is stored as C#, but any capital letter followed by #. Conversely, c++ ( and any other lower-cased letter followed by a ++) is indexed as c (regardless of whether c is in your noise word list).</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/46/sven">Sven</a>, you reached the same conclusion as I did: I found the Shockwave Flash Object, all be it from a slightly different route, but was stumped on how to load the files from somewhere other than file on disk/URL. The F-IN-BOX, although just a wrapper of the Shockwave Flash Object seems to provide much more functionality, which may just help me!</p>

<p>Shooting flys with bazookas may be fun, but an embeded web brower is not the path that I am looking for. :)</p>

<p><em>There was a link on Adobe's site that talked about "Embedding and Communicating with the Macromedia Flash Player in C# Windows Applications" but they seem to have removed it :(</em></p>

<p>What I did when working against a database of unknown performance was to measure turnaround time on my queries.  I kept upping the thread count until turn-around time dropped, and dropping the thread count until turn-around time improved (well, it was processes in my environment, but whatever).  </p>

<p>There were moving averages and all sorts of metrics involved, but the take-away lesson was: just adapt to how things are working at the moment.  You never know when the DBAs will improve performance or hardware will be upgraded, or perhaps another process will come along to load down the system while you're running.  So adapt.</p>

<p>Oh, and another thing: avoid process switches if you can - batch things up.</p>

<hr>

<p>Oh, I should make this clear: this all happened at run time, not during development.</p>

<p>You tried old builds, but is there a reason you can't keep going further back in the repository history and seeing exactly when the bug was introduced?</p>

<p>Otherwise, I would suggest adding simple logging of some kind to help track down the problem, though I am at a loss of what specifically you might want to log.</p>

<p>If you can find out what exactly CAN cause this problem, via google and documentation of the exceptions you are getting, maybe that will give further insight on what to look for in the code.</p>
<p>My first choice would be a dedicated heap tool such as <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/286470" rel="nofollow">pageheap.exe</a>.</p>

<p>Rewriting new and delete might be useful, but that doesn't catch the allocs committed by lower-level code. If this is what you want, better to Detour the <code>low-level alloc API</code>s using Microsoft Detours.</p>

<p>Also sanity checks such as: verify your run-time libraries match (release vs. debug, multi-threaded vs. single-threaded, dll vs. static lib), look for bad deletes (eg, delete where delete [] should have been used), make sure you're not mixing and matching your allocs.</p>

<p>Also try selectively turning off threads and see when/if the problem goes away.</p>

<p>What does the call stack etc look like at the time of the first exception?</p>

<p>Rex, I suspect a good place to start looking is solutions that <strong>compress the ViewState</strong> -- they're grabbing ViewState on the server before it's sent down to the client and gzipping it. That's exactly where you want to be.</p>

<p>The trouble with international standards is that pretty much noone uses them. I try where I can, but I am forced to use dd/mm/yyyy almost everywhere in real life, which means I am so used to it it's always a conscious process to use ISO-8601. For the majority of people who don't even try to use ISO-8601 it's even worse. If you can internationalize where you can, I think it's a great advantage.</p>
<p>Yes, you are right to lock at the VSZ.</p>

<p><code>ps u</code> will give you the VSZ and RSS, which are the virtual memory size and resident set size.  The RSS is how much physical memory has been allocated to the process, and the VSZ is the virtual memory size of the process.  If you have several copies of a program running, a lot of the memory in the VSZ will be shared between those processes.</p>

<P>My first action would be as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Build the binaries in "Release" version but creating debug info file (you will find this possibility in project settings).</LI>
<LI>Use Dr Watson as a defualt debugger (DrWtsn32 -I) on a machine on which you want to reproduce the problem.</LI>
<LI>Repdroduce the problem. Dr Watson will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. </LI></OL>
<P>Another try might be using WinDebug as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight. </P>
<P>Maybe these tools will allow you at least to narrow the problem to certain component.</P>
<P>And are you sure that all the components of the project have correct runtime library settings (C/C++ tab, Code Generation category in VS 6.0 project settings)?</P>
<p>Maybe <a href="https://ci-bayes.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">https://ci-bayes.dev.java.net/</a> or <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes/Home/node2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~javabayes/Home/node2.html</a>?</p>

<p>I never played with it either.</p>

<p>Just use glTranslatef (or the DirectX equivalent) to draw a cube using the same code, but moving the relative point where you draw it. Maybe there's a better way to do it though, I'm fairly new to OpenGL. Be sure to set your viewpoint so you can see them all.</p>
<p>See this <a href="http://aspguy.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/reducing-the-page-size-by-storing-viewstate-on-server/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> where the author describes a method for overriding the default behavior for generating the ViewState and instead shows how to save it on the server Session object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In ASP.NET 2.0, ViewState is saved by
  a descendant of PageStatePersister
  class. This class is an abstract class
  for saving and loading ViewsState and
  there are two implemented descendants
  of this class in .Net Framework, named
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister and
  SessionPageStatePersister. By default
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister is used
  to save/load ViewState information,
  but we can easily get the
  SessionPageStatePersister to work and
  save ViewState in Session object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I did not test his code, it seems to show exactly what you want: a way to gain access to ViewState code while still on the server, before postback. </p>
<p>Here is an implementation of Bayesian filtering in C#: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/BayesianCS.aspx" rel="nofollow">A Naive Bayesian Spam Filter for C#</a> (hosted on CodeProject).</p>
<p>You say you have enough trouble getting one cube to display... so I am not sure if you have got one to display or not.</p>

<p>Basically... put your code for writing a cube in one function, then just call that function 100 times.</p>

<pre><code>void DrawCube()<br>{<br>    //code to draw the cube<br>}<br><br>void DisplayCubes()<br>{<br>    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)<br>    {   <br>         for(int j = 0; j &lt; 10; ++j)<br>         {<br>             glPushMatrix();<br>             //alter these values depending on the size of your cubes.<br>             //This call makes sure that your cubes aren't drawn overtop of each other<br>             glTranslatef(i*5.0, j*5.0, 0);<br>             DrawCube();<br>             glPopMatrix();<br>         }<br>    }              <br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>That is the basic outline for how you could go about doing this. If you want something more efficient take a look into Display Lists sometime once you have the basics figured out :)</p>
<p>No.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill22.htm">A Pragmatic Look at Exception Specifications</a> for reasons why not. </p>

<p>The only way you can "help" this is to document the exceptions your function can throw, say as a comment in the header file declaring it. This is not enforced by the compiler or anything. Use code reviews for that purpose.</p>

<p><strong>AppDomain.UnhandledException</strong> is an <strong>event</strong>, not a global exception handler. This means, by the time it is raised, your application is already on its way down the drain, and there is nothing you can do about it, except for doing cleanup and error logging.</p>

<p>What happened behind the scenes is this: The framework detected the exception, walked up the call stack to the very top, found no handlers that would recover from the error, so was unable to determine if it was safe to continue execution. So, it started the shutdown sequence, and fired up this event as a courtesy to you so you can pay your respects to your already-doomed process. This happens when an exception is left unhandled in the main thread.</p>

<p>There is no single-point solution to this kind of error. You need to put a real exception handler (a catch block) upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to (for example) a global handler method/class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue, based on exception type and/or content.</p>

<p>Edit: It is possible to disable (=hack) the error-reporting mechanism built into Windows so the mandatory "crash and burn" dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down. However, this becomes effective for <em>all</em> the applications in the system, not just your own.</p>
<p>I've just set up Sandcastle again. Try installing it (the May 2008 release) and search for SandcastleGui.exe or something similar (it's in the examples folder or so).</p>

<p>Click Add Assembly and add your Assembly or Assemblies, add any .xml Documentation files (the ones generated by the compiler if you enabled that option) and then Build.</p>

<p>It will take some time, but the result <strong>will</strong> be worth the effort. It will actually look up stuff from MSDN, so your resulting documentation will also have the Class Inheritance all the way down to System.Object with links to MSDN and stuff.</p>

<p>Sandcastle seems a bit complicated at first, especially when you want to use it in an automated build, but I am absolutely sure it will be worth the effort.</p>

<p>Also have a look at <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB" rel="nofollow">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a>, this is a somewhat more advanced GUI for it.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it needed?</strong></p>

<p>When data is stored on disk based storage devices, it is stored as blocks of data. These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn’t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires <code>N/2</code> block accesses (on average), where <code>N</code> is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn’t contain unique entries) then the entire table space must be searched at <code>N</code> block accesses.</p>

<p>Whereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, this has <code>log2 N</code> block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn’t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial.</p>

<p><strong>What is indexing?</strong></p>

<p>Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.</p>

<p>The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk, since the indexes are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, let’s outline a sample database table schema; </p>

<pre>
Field name       Data type      Size on disk
id (Primary key) Unsigned INT   4 bytes
firstName        Char(50)       50 bytes
lastName         Char(50)       50 bytes
emailAddress     Char(100)      100 bytes
</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value. 
This sample database contains five million rows, and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the <em>id</em> (a sorted key field) and one using the <em>firstName</em> (a non-key unsorted field).</p>

<p><strong><em>Example 1</em></strong></p>

<p>Given our sample database of <code>r = 5,000,000</code> records of a fixed size giving a record length of <code>R = 204</code> bytes and they are stored in a table using the MyISAM engine which is using the default block size <code>B = 1,024</code> bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be <code>bfr = (B/R) = 1024/204 = 5</code> records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is <code>N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/5 = 1,000,000</code> blocks. </p>

<p>A linear search on the id field would require an average of <code>N/2 = 500,000</code> block accesses to find a value given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of <code>log2 1000000 = 19.93 = 20</code> block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement.</p>

<p>Now the <em>firstName</em> field is neither sorted nor a key field, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact <code>N = 1,000,000</code> block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct.</p>

<p>Given that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks than the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the <em>firstName</em> field is outlined below; </p>

<pre>
Field name       Data type      Size on disk
firstName        Char(50)       50 bytes
(record pointer) Special        4 bytes
</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example 2</em></strong></p>

<p>Given our sample database of <code>r = 5,000,000</code> records with an index record length of <code>R = 54</code> bytes and using the default block size <code>B = 1,024</code> bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be <code>bfr = (B/R) = 1024/54 = 18</code> records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is <code>N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/18 = 277,778</code> blocks. </p>

<p>Now a search using the <em>firstName</em> field can utilise the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of <code>log2 277778 = 18.08 = 19</code> block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to <code>19 + 1 = 20</code> block accesses, a far cry from the 277,778 block accesses required by the non-indexed table.</p>

<p><strong>When should it be used?</strong></p>

<p>Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index.</p>

<p>Since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.</p>

<p>HTML would be the next best choice, ONLY IF you would serve them from a public web server. If you tried to bundle it with your app, all the files (and images (and stylesheets (and ...) ) ) would make CHM look like a gift from gods.</p>

<p>That said, when actually bundled in the installation package, (instead of being served over the network), I found the CHM files to work nicely.</p>

<p>OTOH, another pitfall about CHM files: Even if you try to open a CHM file on a <strong>local</strong> disk, you may bump into the security block if you initially downloaded it from somewhere, because the file could be marked as "came from external source" when it was obtained.</p>
<p>Is the question how to generate your own help files, or what is the best help file format?</p>

<p>Personally, I find CHM to be excellent.  One of the first things I do when setting up a machine is to download the PHP Manual in CHM format (<a href="http://www.php.net/download-docs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/download-docs.php</a>) and add a hotkey to it in <a href="http://crimsoneditor.com/" rel="nofollow">Crimson Editor</a>.  So when I press F1 it loads the CHM and performs a search for the word my cursor is on (great for quick function reference).  </p>
<p>Our software is both distributed locally to the clients and served from a network share. We opted for generating both a CHM file and a set of HTML files for serving from the network. Users starting the program locally use the CHM file, and users getting their program served from a network share has to use the HTML files.</p>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.helpandmanual.com/" rel="nofollow">Help and Manual</a> and can thus easily produce both types of output from the same source project. The HTML files also contain searching capabilities and doesn't require a web server, so though it isn't an optimal solution, works fine.</p>

<p>So far all the single-file types for Windows seems broken in one way or another:</p>

<ul>
<li>WinHelp - obsoleted</li>
<li>HtmlHelp (CHM) - obsoleted on Vista, doesn't work from network share, other than that works really nice</li>
<li>Microsoft Help 2 (HXS) - this seems to work right up until the point when it doesn't, corrupted indexes or similar, this is used by Visual Studio 2005 and above, as an example</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, lucky for you that answer can be found on our very own stackoverflow website:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1033/ip-to-country">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1033/ip-to-country</a></p>

<p>spoiler: <a href="http://www.hostip.info/use.html">http://www.hostip.info/use.html</a></p>
<p>Just a shot in the dark because I haven't tried it yet but when you realloc it returns the pointer much like malloc. Because realloc can move the pointer if needed you are most likely operating on an invalid pointer if you don't do the following:</p>

<pre><code>input = realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);<br></code></pre>
<p><strong>Note, try to edit your code to get rid of the html escape codes.</strong></p>

<p>Well, though it has been a while since I used C/C++, realloc that grows only reuses the memory pointer value if there is room in memory after your original block.</p>

<p>For instance, consider this:</p>

<p>(xxxxxxxxxx..........)</p>

<p>If your pointer points to the first x, and . means free memory location, and you grow the memory size pointed to by your variable by 5 bytes, it'll succeed. This is of course a simplified example as blocks are rounded up to a certain size for alignment, but anyway.</p>

<p>However, if you subsequently try to grow it by another 10 bytes, and there is only 5 available, it will need to move the block in memory and update your pointer.</p>

<p>However, in your example you are passing the function a pointer to the character, not a pointer to your variable, and thus while the strrep function internally might be able to adjust the variable in use, it is a local variable to the strrep function and your calling code will be left with the original pointer variable value.</p>

<p>This pointer value, however, has been freed.</p>

<p>In your case, input is the culprit.</p>

<p>However, I would make another suggestion. In your case it looks like the <em>input</em> variable is indeed input, and if it is, it shouldn't be modified, at all.</p>

<p>I would thus try to find another way to do what you want to do, without changing <em>input</em>, as side-effects like this can be hard to track down.</p>
<p>As a general rule, you should <strong>never</strong> do a free or realloc on a user provided buffer. You don't know where the user allocated the space (in your module, in another DLL) so you cannot use any of the allocation functions on a user buffer.</p>

<p>Provided that you now cannot do any reallocation within your function, you should change a little its behavior like doing only one replacement, so the user will be able to compute the resulting string max length and provide you with a buffer long enough for this one replacement to occur.</p>

<p>Then you could create another function to do the multiple replacements, but you will have to allocate the whole space for the resulting string and copy the user input string. Then you must provide a way to delete the string you allocated.</p>

<p>Resulting in:</p>

<pre><code>void  strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);<br>char* strrepm(char *input, char *search, char *replace);<br>void  strrepmfree(char *input);<br></code></pre>
<P>My quick hints.</P>
<P>Instead of: <BR><CODE>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace)</CODE> <BR>try: <BR><CODE>void strrep(char *&amp;input, char *search, char *replace)</CODE></P>
<P>and than in the body: <BR><CODE>input = realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);</CODE></P>
<P>Generally read about passing function arguments as values/reference and realloc() description :).</P>
<p>The following is SQL92 standard so should be supported by the majority of RDMBS that use SQL:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX [index name] ON [table name] ( [column name] )<br></code></pre>
<p>This seems to work;</p>

<pre><code>char *strrep(char *string, const char *search, const char *replace) {<br>    char *p = strstr(string, search);<br><br>    if (p) {<br>        int occurrence = p - string;<br>        int stringlength = strlen(string);<br>        int searchlength = strlen(search);<br>        int replacelength = strlen(replace);<br><br>        if (replacelength &gt; searchlength) {<br>            string = (char *) realloc(string, strlen(string) <br>                + replacelength - searchlength + 1);<br>        }<br><br>        if (replacelength != searchlength) {<br>            memmove(string + occurrence + replacelength, <br>                        string + occurrence + searchlength, <br>                        stringlength - occurrence - searchlength + 1);<br>        }<br><br>        strncpy(string + occurrence, replace, replacelength);<br>    }<br><br>    return string;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Sigh, is there anyway to post code without it sucking?</p>
<p>I am currently "manually" doing it through a prebuild-exec Task, using my <a href="http://www.stum.de/various-tools/cmdtools/" rel="nofollow">cmdnetsvnrev</a> tool, but if someone knows a better ccnet-integrated way of doing it, i'd be happy to hear :-)</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svnrevisionlabeller" rel="nofollow">this</a> project on google code. This is <code>CCNET</code> plugin to generate the label in <code>CCNET</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>DLL</code> is tested with <code>CCNET 1.3</code> but it works with <code>CCNET 1.4</code> for me. I'm successfully using this plugin to label my build.</p>

<p>Now onto passing it to <code>MSBuild</code>...</p>

<p>You have basically two options. Either you write a simple script that will start and parse output from</p>

<p><strong>svn.exe info --revision HEAD</strong></p>

<p>to obtain revision number (then generating AssemblyInfo.cs is pretty much straight forward) or just use plugin for CCNET. Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SVN Revision Labeller</strong> is a plugin for
  CruiseControl.NET that allows you to
  generate CruiseControl labels for your
  builds, based upon the revision number
  of your Subversion working copy. This
  can be customised with a prefix and/or
  major/minor version numbers.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/svnrevisionlabeller/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/svnrevisionlabeller/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I prefer the first option because it's only roughly 20 lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace SvnRevisionNumberParserSample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Process p = Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo()
                {
                    FileName = @"C:\Program Files\SlikSvn\bin\svn.exe", // path to your svn.exe
                    UseShellExecute = false,
                    RedirectStandardOutput = true,
                    Arguments = "info --revision HEAD",
                    WorkingDirectory = @"C:\MyProject" // path to your svn working copy
                });

            // command "svn.exe info --revision HEAD" will produce a few lines of output
            p.WaitForExit();

            // our line starts with "Revision: "
            while (!p.StandardOutput.EndOfStream)
            {
                string line = p.StandardOutput.ReadLine();
                if (line.StartsWith("Revision: "))
                {
                    string revision = line.Substring("Revision: ".Length);
                    Console.WriteLine(revision); // show revision number on screen                       
                    break;
                }
            }

            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you prefer doing it on the <code>MSBuild</code> side over the <code>CCNet</code> config, looks like the <code>MSBuild</code> Community Tasks extension's <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow"><code>SvnVersion</code></a> task might do the trick.</p>

<p>A dictionary may also contain overhead, depending on the actual implementation. A hashtable usually contain some prime number of available nodes to begin with, even though you might only use a couple of the nodes.</p>

<p>Judging by your example, "Property", would you be better of with a class approach for the final level and real properties? Or is the names of the properties changing a lot from node to node?</p>

<p>I'd say that what "efficient" means depends on a lot of things, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>speed of updates (insert, update, delete)</li>
<li>speed of random access retrieval</li>
<li>speed of sequential retrieval</li>
<li>memory used</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that you'll find that a data structure that is speedy will generally consume more memory than one that is slow. This isn't always the case, but most data structures seems to follow this.</p>

<p>A dictionary might be easy to use, and give you relatively uniformly fast access, it will most likely use more memory than, as you suggest, lists. Lists, however, generally tend to contain more overhead when you insert data into it, unless they preallocate X nodes, in which they will again use more memory.</p>

<p>My suggestion, in general, would be to just use the method that seems the most natural to you, and then do a "stress test" of the system, adding a substantial amount of data to it and see if it becomes a problem.</p>

<p>You might also consider adding a layer of abstraction to your system, so that you don't have to change the programming interface if you later on need to change the internal data structure.</p>
<p>If you are doing "just extract and run", you are going to run in security issues.  This is especially true if you are users are running Vista (or later).  is there a reason why you wanted to avoid packaging your applications inside an installer?  Using an installer would alleviate the "external source" problem.  You would be able to use .chm files without any problems.</p>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.installaware.com" rel="nofollow">InstallAware</a> to create our install packages.  It's not cheap, but is very good.  If cost is your concern, <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">WIX</a> is open source and pretty robust.  WIX does have a learning curve, but it's easy to work with.</p>
<p>The GNU C library regular expressions facility (regcomp(), regexec() and friends) is broken. Use libetre instead; the function signatures match the ones provided by glibc.

<p>The trick to that is to use URL rewriting so that <strong>name.domain.com</strong> transparently maps to something like <strong>domain.com/users/name</strong> on your server.  Once you start down that path, it's fairly trivial to implement.</p>
<p>Well, you didn't specify Rails, so I'm going to throw <a href="https://github.com/shoes/shoes">Shoes</a> out there. First, building shoes apps is probably the best way to learn Ruby (Rails is great, but I find mastering Ruby far more fun/useful). Secondly, while I certainly don't think building crossplatform UI components is trivial, shoes is relatively new, and relatively small. There are no doubt countless additions that could be made.</p>

<p><strong>Don't worry about DNS and URL rewriting</strong></p>

<p>Your DNS record will be static, something like:</p>

<pre><code>*.YOURDOMAIN.COM A 123.123.123.123<br></code></pre>

<p>Ask your DNS provider to do it for you (if it's not done already) or do it by yourself if you have control over your DNS records. This will automatically point all your subdomains (current and future ones) into the same HTTP server.</p>

<p>Once it's done, you will only need to parse HOST header on every single http request to detect what hostname was used to access your server-side scripts on your http server.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using ASP.NET, this is kind of silly example I came up with but works and demonstrates simplicity of this approach:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Language="C#" %&gt;<br>&lt;%<br>string subDomain = Request.Url.Host.Split('.')[0].ToUpper();<br>if (subDomain == "CLIENTXXX") Response.Write("Hello CLIENTXXX, your secret number is 33");<br>else if (subDomain == "CLIENTYYY") Response.Write("Hello CLIENTYYY, your secret number is 44");<br>else Response.Write(subDomain+" doesn't exist");<br>%&gt;<br></code></pre>
<p>I've been doing a little research into this and whilst I'm not entirely sure its the cause I believe it is because Safari is not returning the full result set (hence cropping it).</p>

<p>I have been in dicussion with another developer and found the following post on Channel 9 as well which recommends making use of the SQL State service to store the viewstate avoiding the postback issue and also page size.</p>

<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/forums/TechOff/250549-ASPNET-ViewState-flawed-architecture/?CommentID=270477#263702" rel="nofollow">http://channel9.msdn.com/forums/TechOff/250549-ASPNET-ViewState-flawed-architecture/?CommentID=270477#263702</a></p>

<p>Does this seem like the best solution?</p>
<p>Making a class-based structure would probably have more overhead than the dict-based structure, since in python classes actually use dicts when they are implemented.</p>
<p>My first port of call would be to go through the elements on the page and see which controls:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will still work when I switch ViewState off</li>
<li>Can be moved out of the page and into an AJAX call to be loaded when required</li>
</ol>

<p>Failing that, and here's the disclaimer - I've never used this solution on a web-facing site - but in the past where I've wanted to eliminate massive ViewStates in limited-audience applications I have stored the ViewState in the Session.</p>

<p>It has worked for me because the hit to memory isn't significant for the number of users, but if you're running a fairly popular site I wouldn't recommend this approach.  However, if the Session solution works for Safari you could always detect the user agent and fudge appropriately.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Found the above technique to auto-gen AssemblyInfo.cs using MSBuild. Will post sample shortly.</p>
<p>C and C++ compilers will generate a warning when you compare signed and unsigned types; in your example code, you couldn't make your loop variable unsigned and have the compiler generate code without warnings (assuming said warnings were turned on).</p>

<p>Naturally, you're compiling with warnings turned all the way up, right?</p>

<p>And, have you considered compiling with "treat warnings as errors" to take it that one step further?</p>

<p>The downside with using signed numbers is that there's a temptation to overload them so that, for example, the values 0-&gt;n are the menu selection, and -1 means nothing's selected - rather than creating a class that has two variables, one to indicate if something is selected and another to store what that selection is.  Before you know it, you're testing for negative one all over the place and the compiler is complaining about how you're wanting to compare the menu selection against the number of menu selections you have - but that's dangerous because they're different types.  So don't do that.</p>
<p>The way we do this is to have a 'catch all' for our domain name registered in DNS so that anything.ourdomain.com will point to our server.</p>

<p>With Apache you can set up a similar catch-all for your vhosts.  The ServerName must be a single static name but the ServerAlias directive can contain a pattern.</p>

<pre><code>Servername www.ourdomain.com
ServerAlias *.ourdomain.com
</code></pre>

<p>Now all of the domains will trigger the vhost for our project.  The final part is to decode the domain name actually used so that you can work out the username in your code, something like (PHP):</p>

<pre><code>list( $username ) = explode( ".", $_SERVER[ "HTTP_HOST" ] );
</code></pre>

<p>or a RewriteRule as already suggested that silently maps user.ourdomain.com/foo/bar to www.ourdomain.com/foo/bar?user=user or whatever you prefer.</p>

<p>I have written a NAnt build file that handles parsing SVN information and creating properties. I then use those property values for a variety of build tasks, including setting the label on the build. I use this target combined with the SVN Revision Labeller mentioned by lubos hasko with great results.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name="svninfo" description="get the svn checkout information"&gt;<br>    &lt;property name="svn.infotempfile" value="${build.directory}\svninfo.txt" /&gt;<br>    &lt;exec program="${svn.executable}" output="${svn.infotempfile}"&gt;<br>        &lt;arg value="info" /&gt;<br>    &lt;/exec&gt;<br>    &lt;loadfile file="${svn.infotempfile}" property="svn.info" /&gt;<br>    &lt;delete file="${svn.infotempfile}" /&gt;<br><br>    &lt;property name="match" value="" /&gt;<br><br>    &lt;regex pattern="URL: (?'match'.*)" input="${svn.info}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;property name="svn.info.url" value="${match}"/&gt;<br><br>    &lt;regex pattern="Repository Root: (?'match'.*)" input="${svn.info}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;property name="svn.info.repositoryroot" value="${match}"/&gt;<br><br>    &lt;regex pattern="Revision: (?'match'\d+)" input="${svn.info}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;property name="svn.info.revision" value="${match}"/&gt;<br><br>    &lt;regex pattern="Last Changed Author: (?'match'\w+)" input="${svn.info}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;property name="svn.info.lastchangedauthor" value="${match}"/&gt;<br><br>    &lt;echo message="URL: ${svn.info.url}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;echo message="Repository Root: ${svn.info.repositoryroot}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;echo message="Revision: ${svn.info.revision}" /&gt;<br>    &lt;echo message="Last Changed Author: ${svn.info.lastchangedauthor}" /&gt;<br>&lt;/target&gt;<br></code></pre>
<p>While I second the Channel 9 solution, also be aware that in some hosted environments Safari is not considered an up-level browser. You may need to add it to your application's browscap in order to make use of some ASP.Net features. </p>

<p>That was the root cause of some headaches we had for a client's site that used the ASP Menu control.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use an installer and you don't want the user to perform any extra steps to allow CHM files over the network, why not fall back to WinHelp?

<p>With Perl you can surround the data you want with ()'s and pull it out later, perhaps other languages have a similar feature.</p>

<p>I don't know how accurate that hostip.info site is.  I just visted that site, and it reported that my country is Canada.  I'm in the US and the ISP that my office uses only operates from the US.  It does allow you to correct it's guess, but if you are using this service to track web site vistors by country, you'll have no way of knowing if the data is correct.  Of course, I'm just one data point.  I downloaded the GeoLite Country database, which is just a .csv file, and my IP address was correctly identified as US.</p>

<p>Another benefit of the MaxMind product line (paid or free) is that you have the data, you don't incur the performance hit of making a web service call to another system.</p>

<p>Now this is very specific to that project, but a lot of stuff apllies in general.</p>

<p>Pro Subversion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Support for versioned renames/moves (impossible with CVS): Fingolfin, Ender</li>
  <li>Supports directories natively: It's possible to remove them, and they are versioned: Fingolfin, Ender</li>
  <li>File properties are versioned; no more "executable bit" hell: Fingolfin</li>
  <li>Overall revision number makes build versioning and regression testing much easier: Ender, Fingolfin</li>
  <li>Atomic commits: Fingolfin</li>
  <li>Intuitive (directory-based) branching and tagging: Fingolfin</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'll just post here since some of the other posts are slightly inaccurate in relation to C#.</p>

<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <code>int</code> is an alias for <code>System.Int32</code>.<br/>
<strong>Wrong:</strong> <code>float</code> is not an alias for <code>System.Float</code>, but for <code>System.Single</code></p>

<p>Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the <code>System.Int32</code> value type.</p>

<p>float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''<code>float</code>'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly.</p>

<p>In C# there is no difference between ''<code>int</code>'' and ''<code>System.Int32</code>'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.</p>

<p>Wether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.</p>

<p>This declaration in a method:</p>

<pre><code>int i;
</code></pre>

<p>defines a variable <code>i</code> of type <code>System.Int32</code>, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)</p>

<p>To get a heap object, you can use boxing:</p>

<pre><code>object o = i;
</code></pre>

<p>this will create a boxed copy of the contents of <code>i</code> on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value. (Ugh, this paragraph doesn't read all that easily.)</p>

<p>The Subversion book has <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.forcvs.html">an appendix</a> that details important differences from CVS, which may help you make your decision.  The two approaches are more or less the same idea but SVN was specifically designed to fix long standing flaws in CVS so, in theory at least, SVN will always be the better choice.</p>
<p>CVS only tracks modification on a file-by-file basis, while SVN tracks a whole commit as a new revision, which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project. Add the fact that all modern source control software use the concept of revision so it is far easier to migrate from SVN than it is from CVS.</p>

<p>There is also the atomic commit problem. While I only encountered it once, it is possible that 2 people committing together in CVS can conflict each other, losing some data and putting your client in an inconsistent state. When detected early, these problems are not major because your data is still out there somewhere, but it can be a pain in a stressful environment.</p>

<p>And finally, not many tools are developed around CVS anymore. While the new and shiny-new tools like Git or Mercurial definitely lack tools yet, SVN has a pretty large application base on any system.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2015</strong>: Seriously, this answer is 7 years old now. Forget SVN, go use Git like everyone else!</p>

<p>When I needed to write an application with a client-server model where the clients could leave and enter whenever they want, (I assume that's also the case for your application as you use mobile devices) I made sure that the clients send an <em>online</em> message to the server, indicating they were connected and ready to do whatever they needed doing.</p>

<p>at that time the server could send messages back to the client trough the same open connection.</p>

<p>Also, but I don't know if that is applicable for you, I had some sort of <em>heartbeat</em> the clients sent to the server, letting it know it was still online. That way the server knows when a client was forcibly disconnected from the network and it could mark that client back as offline.</p>
<p>SVN has 3 main advantages over CVS</p>

<ul>
<li>it's faster</li>
<li>supports versioning of binary files</li>
<li>and adds transactional commit (all or nothing)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the artifact directory variable inside the MSBuild script itself.  Here's an example of how I'm running FxCop right now from my CC.Net MSBuild script (this script is what CC.Net points to - there is also a "Build" target in the script that includes an MSBuild task against the SLN to do the actual compilation):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Exec

<p>Why wouldn't you just use an array with a size of 2?  A Queue is supposed to be able to dynamically grow and shrink.</p>

<p>Or create a wrapper class around an instance of <code>Queue&lt;T&gt;</code> instance and each time one enqueues a <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> object, check the size of the queue.  If larger than 2, dequeue the first item.</p>

<p>You should create your own class, a ringbuffer would probably fit your needs.</p>

<p>The data structures in .NET that allows you to specify capacity, except for array, uses this to build the internal data structure used to hold the internal data.</p>

<p>For instance, for a list, capacity is used to size an internal array. When you start adding elements to the list, it'll start filling this array from index 0 and up, and when it reaches your capacity, it increases the capacity to a new higher capacity, and continues filling it up.</p>
<p>I've knocked up a basic version of what I'm looking for, it's not perfect but it'll do the job until something better comes along.</p>

<pre><code>public class LimitedQueue&lt;T&gt; : Queue&lt;T&gt;<br>{<br>    private int limit = -1;<br><br>    public int Limit<br>    {<br>        get { return limit; }<br>        set { limit = value; }<br>    }<br><br>    public LimitedQueue(int limit)<br>        : base(limit)<br>    {<br>        this.Limit = limit;<br>    }<br><br>    public new void Enqueue(T item)<br>    {<br>        if (this.Count &gt;= this.Limit)<br>        {<br>            this.Dequeue();<br>        }<br>        base.Enqueue(item);<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>No, unfortunately, and if you think about it, that information would be worthless anyway since the file could become locked the very next second (read: short timespan).</p>

<p>Why specifically do you need to know if the file is locked anyway? Knowing that might give us some other way of giving you good advice.</p>

<p>If your code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>if not locked then
    open and update file
</code></pre>

<p>Then between the two lines, another process could easily lock the file, giving you the same problem you were trying to avoid to begin with: exceptions.</p>

<p>I was just listening to a <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=135" rel="nofollow">Podcast from Scott Hanselman</a> this morning, where he talks about internationalization, especially the really tricky things, like Turkish (with it's four i's) and Thai. Also, Jeff Atwood had a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001075.html" rel="nofollow">post</a>:</p>

<p>The problem with a generic tool is that it is very difficult to come up with a set of rules that will only match against a genuine attack.</p>

<p>SQL keywords are all English words and don't forget that the string</p>

<pre><code> DROP TABLE users;<br></code></pre>

<p>is perfectly valid in a form field that, for example, contains an answer to a programming question.</p>

<p>The only sensible option is to sanitise the input before ever passing it to your database but pass it on nonetheless.  Otherwise lots of perfectly normal, non-malicious users are going to get banned from your site.</p>
<p>You might be able to get some implementation ideas from the <a href="http://0xcc.net/ruby-progressbar/">Ruby/ProgressBar library</a>, which generates text progress bars. I stumbled across it a couple of months back but haven't made any use of it.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is more a question of personal preference.  nAnt is a great framework and MSBuild is almost as capable.  With the ability to easily develop custom tasks (in both frameworks) you can accomplish almost anything that you need to do.</p>

<p>I cannot answer the "still supported" portion of your questions, but I would say if you are already comfortable with nAnt then it's probably viable.  If you (or someone in your group) is familiar with MSBuild then that is a fine way to go as well.</p>

<p>The easiest <em>distance</em> would of course be to just consider the colors as 3d vectors originating from the same origin, and taking the distance between their end points.</p>

<p>If you need to consider such factors that green is more prominent in judging intensity, you can weigh the values.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color/#grayscale" rel="nofollow">ImageMagic</a> provides the following scales:  </p>

<ul>
<li>red: 0.3</li>
<li>green: 0.6</li>
<li>blue: 0.1</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, values like this would only be meaningful in relation to other values for other colors, not as something that would be meaningful to humans, so all you could use the values for would be similiarity ordering.</p>
<p>HSL and HSV are better for human color perception. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is sometimes preferable in working with art materials, digitized images, or other media, to use the HSV or HSL color model over alternative models such as RGB or CMYK, because of differences in the ways the models emulate how humans perceive color. RGB and CMYK are additive and subtractive models, respectively, modelling the way that primary color lights or pigments (respectively) combine to form new colors when mixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One method that might work for some cases would be to take the sql string that would run if you naively used the form data and pass it to some code that counts the number of statements that would actually be executed.  If it is greater than the number expected, then there is a decent chance that an injection was attempted, especially for fields that are unlikely to include control characters such as username.</p>

<p>Something like a normal text box would be a bit harder since this method would be a lot more likely to return false positives, but this would be a start, at least.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy (Robust File Copy)</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>In Windows Vista and Server 2008 when you type:</p>

<pre><code>xcopy /?<br></code></pre>

<p>you get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Xcopy is now deprecated, please use Robocopy.</p>

<p>So start getting used to robocopy :)</p>
<p>Why not use LINQ:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; myDict = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
myDict.Add("one", 1);
myDict.Add("four", 4);
myDict.Add("two", 2);
myDict.Add("three", 3);

var sortedDict = from entry in myDict orderby entry.Value ascending select entry;
</code></pre>

<p>This would also allow for great flexibility in that you can select the top 10, 20 10% etc. Or if you are using your word frequency index for <code>type-ahead</code>, you could also include <code>StartsWith</code> clause as well.</p>

<p>One little thing to keep in mind: In some countries (i.e. most of Europe), people do not have static IP Addresses, so blacklisting should not be forever.</p>

<p>It sounds like a backup-style tool may be what you're looking for.</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">SyncBack</a> (one of the versions is free). You could also try out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncToy" rel="nofollow">MS SyncToy</a> which tries to make moving, copying, syncing, etc. easy.</p>

<p>If you really do copy just random files at random times, you could try <a href="http://www.ranvik.net/totalcopy/" rel="nofollow">Total Copy</a> which has the added benefit of working well over a network (pause, resume, etc.).</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, a Bayesian filter similar to the ones used to block spam might work decently too.  If you got together a set of normal text for each field and a set of sql injections, you might be able to train it to flag injection attacks.</p>
<p>You really need to use a file Sync tool, like <a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/syncback/syncback-hub.html">SyncBackSE</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C26EFA36-98E0-4EE9-A7C5-98D0592D8C52&amp;displaylang=en">MS SyncToy</a>, or even something like <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> will do the trick.
I prefer SyncBack as it allows you to set up very explicit rules for just about every possible case and conflict, at least more so than the other two.
With any of these you won't have to keep clicking all the pop-ups and you can verify, without a doubt, that the destination is exactly the same as the source.</p>
<p>The physical database size doesn't matter.  The number of records don't matter.</p>

<p>In my experience the biggest problem that you are going to run in to is not size, but the number of queries you can handle at a time.  Most likely you are going to have to move to a master/slave configuration so that the read queries can run against the slaves and the write queries run against the master.  However if you are not ready for this yet, you can always tweak your indexes for the queries you are running to speed up the response times.  Also there is a lot of tweaking you can do to the network stack and kernel in Linux that will help.</p>

<p>I have had mine get up to 10GB, with only a moderate number of connections and it handled the requests just fine.</p>

<p>I would focus first on your indexes, then have a server admin look at your OS, and if all that doesn't help it might be time to implement a master/slave configuration.</p>

<p>How about good old Command-Line Xcopy? With S: being the source and T: the target:</p>

<pre><code>xcopy /K /R /E /I /S /C /H /G /X /Y s:\*.* t:\
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>/K    Copies attributes. Normal Xcopy will reset read-only attributes.</p>
  
  <p>/R    Overwrites read-only files.</p>
  
  <p>/E    Copies directories and subdirectories, including empty ones.</p>
  
  <p>/I    If destination does not exist and copying more than one file, assumes that destination must be a directory.</p>
  
  <p>/S    Copies directories and subdirectories except empty ones.</p>
  
  <p>/C    Continues copying even if errors occur.</p>
  
  <p>/H    Copies hidden and system files also.</p>
  
  <p>/Y    Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.</p>
  
  <p>/G    Allows the copying of encrypted files to destination that does not support encryption.</p>
  
  <p>/X    Copies file audit settings (implies /O).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Edit: Added /G and /X which are new since a few years)</p>
<p>Do you mean that from a set of N colors, you need to pick M colors, where M &lt; N, such that M is the <em>best</em> representation of the N colors in the M space?</p>

<p>As a better example, reduce a true-color (24 bit color space) to a 8-bit mapped color space (GIF?).</p>

<p>There are quantization algorithms for this, like the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/www/quantize.html" rel="nofollow">Adaptive Spatial Subdivision</a> algorithm used by ImageMagic.</p>

<p>These algorithms usually don't just pick existing colors from the source space but creates new colors in the target space that most closely resemble the source colors. As a simplified example, if you have 3 colors in the original image where two are red (with different intensity or bluish tints etc.) and the third is blue, and need to reduce to two colors, the target image could have a red color that is some kind of average of the original two red + the blue color from the original image.</p>

<p>If you need something else then I didn't understand your question :)</p>
<p>You can try <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/supercopier/">SuperCopier</a>, it replaces the standard Windows copy mechanism while loaded.</p>

<p>It can retry failed files at the end, resume a canceled copy (even a copy canceled by Windows), accepts "All" for every answers. You can even answer the annoying questions (file already exists, error copying file) before they occur.</p>
<p>You can split them in to RGB HEX format so that you can compare the R with R's of a different color, same with the G and B.</p>

<p>Same format as HTML </p>

<pre><code>XX XX XX<br>RR GG BB<br><br>00 00 00 = black<br>ff ff ff = white<br>ff 00 00 = red<br>00 ff 00 = green<br>00 00 ff = blue<br></code></pre>

<p>So the only thing you would need to decide is how close you want the colors and what is an acceptable difference for the segments to be considered different. </p>
<p>Honestly it depends on what fits in to your environment better.  If you are using a lot of Non-Microsoft tools, nunit, ccnet, ncover.  You will probably find better support with nant.  Alternatively if you are using MSTest, TFSBuild, you will probably find MSBuild a better environment.  I would learn both and use which every fits more smoothly with your environment.</p>
<p>Well, as a first point of call, I'd say of the common metrics HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) or HSL are better representative of how humans perceive colour than say RGB or CYMK. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV" rel="nofollow">HSL, HSV on Wikipedia</a>. </p>

<p>I suppose naively I would plot the points in the HSL space for the two colours and calculate the magnitude of the difference vector. However this would mean that bright yellow and bright green would be considered just as different as green to dark green. But then many consider red and pink two different colours.</p>

<p>Moreover, difference vectors in the same direction in this parameter space are not equal. For instance, the human eye picks up green much better than other colours. A shift in hue from green by the same amount as a shift from red may seem greater. Also a shift in saturation from a small amount to zero is the difference between grey and pink, elsewhere the shift would be the difference between two shades of red.</p>

<p>From a programmers point of view, you would need to plot the difference vectors but modified by a proportionality matrix that would adjust the lengths accordingly in various regions of the HSL space - this would be fairly arbitrary and would be based on various colour theory ideas but be tweaked fairly arbitrarily depending on what you wanted to apply this to.</p>

<p>Even better, you could see if anyone has already done such a thing online...</p>
<p>This also sounds to me like some kind of <em>resistance graph</em> where you try to map out the path of least resistance. If you inverse the requirements, path of maximum resistance, it could perhaps be used to produce a set that from the start produces maximum difference as you go, and towards the end starts to go back to values closer to the others.</p>

<p>For instance, here's one way to perhaps do what you want.</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate the distance (ref <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1313/followup-finding-an-accurate-distance-between-colors" rel="nofollow">your other post</a>) from each color to all other colors</li>
<li>Sum the distances for each color, this gives you an indication for <em>how far away this color is from all other colors in total</em></li>
<li>Order the list by distance, going down</li>
</ol>

<p>This would, it seems, produce a list that starts with the color that is farthest away from all other colors, and then go down, colors towards the end of the list would be closer to other colors in general.</p>

<p>Edit: Reading your reply to my first post, about the spatial subdivision, would not exactly fit the above description, since colors close to other colors would fall to the bottom of the list, but let's say you have a cluster of colors somewhere, at least one of the colors from that cluster would be located near the start of the list, and it would be the one that generally was farthest away from all other colors in total. If that makes sense.</p>
<p>Xcopy keeps the Date Modified, only the Date Created and Date Accessed will change.</p>

<p>(tested on XP Pro, try it on a small folder to check if you're using Vista as I did not test it under Vista)</p>

<p>Edit: You MAY want to redirect the Output though:</p>

<pre><code>xcopy /K /R ....... s:\*.* t:\ &gt;c:\xcopy.log 2&gt;&amp;1<br></code></pre>

<p>That way, if files fail to copy you can check the log (i.e. System Volume Information will generate an error, but that folder does not matter anyway for what you're trying to do)</p>
<p>Your almost looking at it the wrong way, no 3party tool that is not aware of your application methods/naming/data/domain is going to going to be able to perfectly protect you.</p>

<p>Something like SQL injection prevention is something that has to be in the code, and best written by the people that wrote the SQL, because they are the ones that will know what should/shouldnt be in those fields (unless your project has very good docs)</p>

<p>Your right, this all has been done before. You dont quite have to reinvent the wheel, but you do have to carve a new one because of a differences in everyone's axle diameters.</p>

<p>This is not a drop-in and run problem, you really do have to be familiar with what exactly SQL injection is before you can prevent it. It is a sneaky problem, so it takes equally sneaky protections.</p>

<p>These 2 links taught me far more then the basics on the subject to get started, and helped me better phrase my future lookups on specific questions that weren't answered.</p>

<p>The CC.Net interface is generated via an XSL transform on your XML files put together as specified in the ccnet.config file for your projects.

<p>If you've already got a bunch of custom tasks you use with nAnt, stick with it - you don't gain much with MSBuild.  That said, there doesn't seem to be anything that nAnt can do that MSBuild can't at its core.  Both can call external tools, both can run .Net-based custom tasks, and both have a bunch of community tasks out there.</p>

<p>We're using MSBuild here for the same reason you are - it's the default build system for VS now, and we didn't have any nAnt-specific stuff to worry about.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">MSBuildCommunityTasks</a> are a good third-party task base to start with, and covers most of the custom stuff I ever did in nAnt, including VSS and Subversion support.</p>
<p>On windows, curses works out of the box, ncurses doesn't, and for a progress bar curses should be sufficient. So, use curses instead of ncurses.</p>

<p>Also, both curses and ncurses are wafer-thin wrappers around the c library - that means you don't really need Ruby-specific tutorials.</p>

<p>However, on the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby/source_code" rel="nofollow">site for the PickAxe</a> you can download all the code examples for the book. The file "ex1423.rb" contains a curses demo which plays Pong - that should give you plenty of material to get you going.</p>

<p>Personally I think curses is overkill in this case.  While the curses lib is nice (and I frequently use it myself) it's a PITA to relearn every time I haven't needed it for 12 months which has to be the sign of a bad interface design.</p>

<p>If for some reason you can't get on with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1306/#1318">the progress bar lib Joey suggested</a> roll your own and release it under a pretty free licence for instant kudos :)</p>

<p>Here is a solution that works in XP / Vista, but is definitely expandable to OSX, linux, I'd still be interested in another way.</p>

<pre><code>public static function GetCurrentOSUser():String{
    // XP &amp; Vista only.
    var userDirectory:String = File.userDirectory.resolvePath("").nativePath;
    var startIndex:Number = userDirectory.lastIndexOf("\\") + 1
    var stopIndex:Number = userDirectory.length;
    var user = userDirectory.substring(startIndex, stopIndex);

    return user;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy" rel="nofollow">Robocopy</a>, it has the ability to copy files in "restartable mode", plus it should respect the file attributes.  And it comes with Vista and Server 2008, and you can download it for older OS's.  Plus you can set it to retry on failed copies, to pick up files that are temporarily in use by another process.</p>
<p>Unit testing is, roughly speaking, testing bits of your code in isolation with test code. The immediate advantages that come to mind are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running the tests becomes automate-able and repeatable</li>
<li>You can test at a much more granular level than point-and-click testing via a GUI</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if your test code writes to a file, opens a database connection or does something over the network, it's more appropriately categorized as an integration test. Integration tests are a good thing, but should not be confused with unit tests. Unit test code should be short, sweet and quick to execute.</p>

<p>Another way to look at unit testing is that you write the tests first. This is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD for short). TDD brings additional advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't write speculative "I might need this in the future" code -- just enough to make the tests pass</li>
<li>The code you've written is always covered by tests</li>
<li>By writing the test first, you're forced into thinking about how you want to call the code, which usually improves the design of the code in the long run.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not doing unit testing now, I recommend you get started on it. Get a good book, practically any xUnit-book will do because the concepts are very much transferable between them. </p>

<p>Sometimes writing unit tests can be painful. When it gets that way, try to find someone to help you, and resist the temptation to "just write the damn code". Unit testing is a lot like washing the dishes. It's not always pleasant, but it keeps your metaphorical kitchen clean, and you really want it to be clean. :)</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: One misconception comes to mind, although I'm not sure if it's so common. I've heard a project manager say that unit tests made the team write all the code twice. If it looks and feels that way, well, you're doing it wrong. Not only does writing the tests usually speed up development, but it also gives you a convenient "now I'm done" indicator that you wouldn't have otherwise.</p>

<p>Not sure how credible <a href="http://www.builderau.com.au/program/windows/soa/Getting-started-with-Windows-Server-2008-Core-edition/0,339024644,339288700,00.htm">this source is</a>, but:</p>

<p>Unit testing is the process of writing code to test the behavior and functionality of your system.</p>

<p>Obviously tests improve the quality of your code, but that's just a superficial benefit of unit testing. The real benefit are to</p>

<ol>
<li>Make it easier to change the technical implementation while making sure you don't change the behavior (refactoring). Properly unit tested code can be aggressively refactored/cleaned up with little chance of breaking anything without noticing it.</li>
<li>Give developers confidence when adding behavior or making fixes.</li>
<li>Document your code</li>
<li>Indicate areas of your code that are tightly coupled. It's hard to unit test code that's tightly coupled</li>
<li>Provide a means to use your API and look for difficulties early on</li>
<li>Indicates methods and classes that aren't very cohesive</li>
</ol>

<p>You should unit test because its in your interest to deliver a maintainable and quality product to your client.</p>

<p>I'd suggest you use it for any system, or part of a system, which models real-world behavior. In other words, it's particularly well suited for enterprise development. I would not use it for throw-away/utility programs. I would not use it for parts of a system that are problematic to test (UI is a common example, but that isn't always the case)</p>

<p>The greatest pitfall is that developers test too large a unit, or they consider a method a unit. This is particularly true if you don't understand Inversion of Control - in which case your unit tests will always turn into end-to-end integration testing. Unit test should test individual behaviors - and most methods have many behaviors.</p>

<p>The greatest misconception is that programmers shouldn't test. Only bad or lazy programmers believe that. Should the guy building your roof not test it? Should the doctor replacement a heart valve not test the new valve? Only a programmer can test that his code does what he intended it to do (QA can test edge cases - how code behaves when its told to do things the programmer didn't intend, and the client can do acceptance test - does the code do what what the client paid for it to do)</p>

<p>There are some parallel extensions to .NET that are currently in testing and available at Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/concurrency/default.aspx">Parallel Computing Developer Center</a>. They have a few interesting items that you would expect like Parallel foreach and a parallel version of LINQ called PLINQ. Some of the best information about the extensions is on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/Parallel+Extensions/">Channel 9</a>.</p>
<p>For some reason Jeff's code didn't seem simple enough. To me this seems simpler and easier to understand:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime today = DateTime.Today;
int age = today.Year - bday.Year;

if (bday &gt; today.AddYears(-age))
    age--;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this assumes you are looking for the western idea of age and not using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_age_reckoning">East Asian reckoning</a>.</p>

<p>When you're using .Net 2.0 and Ajax - you should use:</p>

<pre><code>ScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlock
</code></pre>

<p>It will work better in Ajax environments then the old Page.ClientScript version</p>

<p>You can set Apache to serve pages from anywhere with any restrictions but it's normally distributed in a more secure form.</p>

<p>Editing your apache files (http.conf is one of the more common names) will allow you to set any folder so it appears in your webroot.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>alias myapp c:\myapp\</p>

<p>I've edited my answer to include the format for creating an alias in the http.conf file which is sort of like a shortcut in windows or a symlink under un*x where Apache 'pretends' a folder is in the webroot.  This is probably going to be more useful to you in the long term.</p>
<p>You can relocate it by editing the <strong>DocumentRoot</strong> setting in XAMPP\apache\conf\httpd.conf.</p>

<p>It should currently be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C:/xampp/htdocs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Change it to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C:/projects/transitCalculator/trunk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would look into IMAP</p>

<p><a href="http://us3.php.net/imap" rel="nofollow">IMAP, POP3 and NNTP</a></p>

<p>Try changing the argument names to "sender" and "args".  And, after you have it working, switch the call over to ScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlock, regardless of AJAX use.</p>
<p>I'm sure you could write a small app that takes an XSD file and parses it into a SQL script. I've never seen code out there to do it though, but that's not saying it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Ok, per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/#2471">pix0r</a>'s, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/#1413">Sparks</a>' and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/#1414">Dave</a>'s answers it looks like there are three ways to do this:</p>

<hr>

<h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/#2471">Virtual Hosts</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>Open C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf.</li>
<li>Un-comment line 19 (<code>NameVirtualHost *:80</code>).</li>
<li><p>Add your virtual host (~line 36):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    DocumentRoot C:\Projects\transitCalculator\trunk
    ServerName transitcalculator.localhost
    &lt;Directory C:\Projects\transitCalculator\trunk&gt;
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open your hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts).</p></li>
<li><p>Add</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1 transitcalculator.localhost #transitCalculator
</code></pre>

<p>to the end of the file (before the Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy stuff if you have that installed).</p></li>
<li>Save (You might have to save it to the desktop, change the permissions on the old hosts file (right click > properties), and copy the new one into the directory over the old one (or rename the old one) if you are using Vista and have trouble).</li>
<li>Restart Apache.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can access that directory by browsing to <a href="http://transitcalculator.localhost/">http://transitcalculator.localhost/</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/#1413">Make an Alias</a></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Starting ~line 200 of your <code>http.conf</code> file, copy everything between <code>&lt;Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/Directory&gt;</code> (~line 232) and paste it immediately below with <code>C:/xampp/htdocs</code> replaced with your desired directory (in this case <code>C:/Projects</code>) to give your server the correct permissions for the new directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the <code>&lt;IfModule alias_module&gt;&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code> section (~line 300) and add</p>

<pre><code>Alias /transitCalculator "C:/Projects/transitCalculator/trunk"
</code></pre>

<p>(or whatever is relevant to your desires) below the <code>Alias</code> comment block, inside the module tags.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408/#1414">Change your document root</a></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Edit ~line 176 in C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf; change <code>DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"</code> to <code>#DocumentRoot "C:/Projects"</code> (or whatever you want).</p></li>
<li><p>Edit ~line 203 to match your new location (in this case <code>C:/Projects</code>).</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>You have to use forward slashes "/" instead of back slashes "\".</li>
<li>Don't include the trailing "/" at the end.</li>
<li><em>restart your server</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that you are after this</p>

<pre><code>$username = $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'];<br>$password = $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'];<br></code></pre>
<P>I think you pretty much nailed it. Subsonic generates code, so your business objects will be reflective of your database structure. nHibernate uses mapping files which map your business objects to the database so your objects can be structured however you like. </P>
<P>How large of a project is this? Will there be long term support needed? Is the cost effectiveness of Subsonic going to offset any potential scaling issues? </P>
<p>I think if you are attempting to learn a new language do something fun in that language.</p>

<p>I learned python by writing lots of web spiders and little toys and for ruby I'd take exactly the same path.  Instead of finding a project that needs input do a couple of little personal projects to get a feel for the language.  You learn more by doing something then by reading lots of examples and other peoples code in those first few months.</p>

<p>A language like Ruby is structured in such a way you can do something productive straight out of the box without much support so jump right in and do something fun rather than think you have to do something for somebody else right at the beginning of your experimentation with a new language.</p>

<p>have fun with Ruby, it's on my short list of things to play with :)</p>
<p>How about running IE with the HTML favorites file as a parameter?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IExplore file://\windows\fav.htm</p>

<p>I think we could also include non-.NET-specific approaches to parallel processing if those are among the best options to consider.</p>
<p>Or you could start throwing critical exceptions. Surely, an access violation exception will <em>catch</em> your users' attention.</p>
<p>Using SMO/DMO, it isn't too difficult to generate a script of your schema.  Data is a little more fun, but still doable.</p>

<p>In general, I take "Script It" approach, but you might want to consider something along these lines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distinguish between Development and Staging, such that you can Develop with a subset of data ... this I would create a tool to simply pull down some production data, or generate fake data where security is concerned.</li>
<li>For team development, each change to the database will have to be coordinated amongst your team members.  Schema and data changes can be intermingled, but a single script should enable a given feature.  Once all your features are ready, you bundle these up in a single SQL file and run that against a restore of production.</li>
<li>Once your staging has cleared acceptance, you run the single SQL file again on the production machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have used the Red Gate tools and they are <strong>great</strong> tools, but if you can't afford it, building the tools and working this way isn't too far from the ideal.</p>
<p>@Larsenal</p>

<p>If you want to branch outside of .NET there has been a lot of discussion about Intel's <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/" rel="nofollow">Threading Building Blocks</a> which is a parallel library for C++.</p>
<p>Outside the scope of your question so I debated not posting this but in Java there are actually 2 types of exceptions, checked and unchecked. The basic difference is that, much like in <code>c[++]</code>, you dont have to catch an unchecked exception.</p>

<p>For a good reference <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html" rel="nofollow">try this</a> </p>

<p>This isn't much better:</p>

<pre><code>public function createShipment($startZip, $endZip, $weight=null){<br>    $weight = !$weight ? $this-&gt;getDefaultWeight() : $weight;<br>}<br><br>// or...<br><br>public function createShipment($startZip, $endZip, $weight=null){<br>    if ( !$weight )<br>        $weight = $this-&gt;getDefaultWeight();<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>The way I typically go about coding permission systems is having 6 tables.</p>

<ul>
<li>Users - this is pretty straight forward it is your typical users table</li>
<li>Groups - this would be synonymous to your departments</li>
<li>Roles - this is a table with all permissions generally also including a human readable name and a description</li>
<li>Users_have_Groups - this is a many-to-many table of what groups a user belongs to</li>
<li>Users_have_Roles - another many-to-many table of what roles are assigned to an individual user</li>
<li>Groups_have_Roles - the final many-to-many table of what roles each group has</li>
</ul>

<p>At the beginning of a users session you would run some logic that pulls out every role they have assigned, either directory or through a group. Then you code against those roles as your security permissions.</p>

<p>Like I said this is what I typically do but your millage may vary.</p>
<p>It has been a while, so this is not comprehensive.</p>

<p><strong>Character Sets</strong></p>

<p>Unicode is great, but you can't get away with ignoring other character sets. The default character set on Windows XP (English) is Cp1252. On the web, you don't know what a browser will send you (though hopefully your container will handle most of this). And don't be surprised when there are bugs in whatever implementation you are using. Character sets can have interesting interactions with filenames when they move to between machines.</p>

<p><strong>Translating Strings</strong></p>

<p>Translators are, generally speaking, not coders. If you send a source file to a translator, they will break it. Strings should be extracted to resource files (e.g. properties files in Java or resource DLLs in Visual C++). Translators should be given files that are difficult to break and tools that don't let them break them.</p>

<p>Translators do not know where strings come from in a product. It is difficult to translate a string without context. If you do not provide guidance, the quality of the translation will suffer.</p>

<p>While on the subject of context, you may see the same string "foo" crop up in multiple times and think it would be more efficient to have all instances in the UI point to the same resource. This is a bad idea. Words may be very context-sensitive in some languages.</p>

<p>Translating strings costs money. If you release a new version of a product, it makes sense to recover the old versions. Have tools to recover strings from your old resource files.</p>

<p>String concatenation and manual manipulation of strings should be minimized. Use the format functions where applicable.</p>

<p>Translators need to be able to modify hotkeys. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> is print in English; the Germans use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you have a translation process that requires someone to manually cut and paste strings at any time, you are asking for trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Dates, Times, Calendars, Currency, Number Formats, Time Zones</strong></p>

<p>These can all vary from country to country. A comma may be used to denote decimal places. Times may be in 24hour notation. Not everyone uses the Gregorian calendar. You need to be unambiguous, too. If you take care to display dates as MM/DD/YYYY for the USA and DD/MM/YYYY for the UK on your website, the dates are ambiguous unless the user knows you've done it.</p>

<p><strong>Especially Currency</strong></p>

<p>The Locale functions provided in the class libraries will give you the local currency symbol, but you can't just stick a pound (sterling) or euro symbol in front of a value that gives a price in dollars.</p>

<p><strong>User Interfaces</strong></p>

<p>Layout should be dynamic. Not only are strings likely to double in length on translation, the entire UI may need to be inverted (Hebrew; Arabic) so that the controls run from right to left. And that is before we get to Asia.</p>

<p><strong>Testing Prior To Translation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use static analysis of your code to locate problems. At a bare minimum, leverage the tools built into your IDE. (Eclipse users can go to Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings and check for non-externalised strings.)</li>
<li>Smoke test by simulating translation. It isn't difficult to parse a resource file and replace strings with a pseudo-translated version that doubles the length and inserts funky characters. You don't have to speak a language to use a foreign operating system. Modern systems should let you log in as a foreign user with translated strings and foreign locale. If you are familiar with your OS, you can figure out what does what without knowing a single word of the language.</li>
<li>Keyboard maps and character set references are very useful.</li>
<li>Virtualisation would be very useful here.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Non-technical Issues</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes you have to be sensitive to cultural differences (offence or incomprehension may result). A mistake you often see is the use of flags as a visual cue choosing a website language or geography. Unless you want your software to declare sides in global politics, this is a bad idea. If you were French and offered the option for English with St. George's flag (the flag of England is a red cross on a white field), this might result in confusion for many English speakers - assume similar issues will arise with foreign languages and countries. Icons need to be vetted for cultural relevance. What does a thumbs-up or a green tick mean? Language should be relatively neutral - addressing users in a particular manner may be acceptable in one region, but considered rude in another.</p>

<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>

<p>C++ and Java programmers may find the ICU website useful: <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icu-project.org/</a></p>

<p>Like Rob Allen, I use SQL Compare / Data Compare by Redgate. I also use the Database publishing wizard by Microsoft. I also have a console app I wrote in C# that takes a sql script and runs it on a server. This way you can run large scripts with 'GO' commands in it from a command line or in a batch script.</p>

<p>I use Microsoft.SqlServer.BatchParser.dll and Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll libraries in the console application.</p>

<p>This is similar to what Kevin said.  You can have your client state as some javascript object, and when you want to save the state, you serialize the object (using JSON and base64 encoding).  You can then set the fragment of the href to this string.</p>

<pre><code>var encodedState = base64(json(state));<br>var newLocation = oldLocationWithoutFragment + "#" + encodedState;<br><br>document.location = newLocation; // adds new entry in browser history<br>document.location.replace(newLocation); // replaces current entry in browser history<br></code></pre>

<p>The first way will treat the new state as a new location (so the back button will take them to the previous location).  The latter does not.</p>
<p>An approach I've used in various applications is to have a generic PermissionToken class which has a changeable Value property.  Then you query the requested application, it tells you which PermissionTokens are needed in order to use it.</p>

<p>For example, the Shipping application might tell you it needs:</p>

<pre><code>new PermissionToken()<br>{<br>    Target = PermissionTokenTarget.Application,<br>    Action = PermissionTokenAction.View,<br>    Value = "ShippingApp"<br>};<br></code></pre>

<p>This can obviously be extended to Create, Edit, Delete etc and, because of the custom Value property, any application, module or widget can define its own required permissions.  YMMV, but this has always been an efficient method for me which I have found to scale well.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to manipulate <code>location.hash</code> when AJAX updates result in a state change that you'd like to have a discreet URL.  For example, if your page's url is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a client side function executed this code:</p>

<pre><code>// AJAX code to display the "foo" state goes here.

location.hash = 'foo';
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the URL displayed in the browser would be updated to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://example.com/#foo">http://example.com/#foo</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This allows users to bookmark the "foo" state of the page, and use the browser history to navigate between states.</p>

<p>With this mechanism in place, you'll then need to parse out the hash portion of the URL on the client side using JavaScript to create and display the appropriate initial state, as fragment identifiers (the part after the #) are not sent to the server.</p>

<p><a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/">Ben Alman's hashchange plugin</a> makes the latter a breeze if you're using jQuery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way one can ensure that the

</blockquote>

<p>I find it rather funny, that the Java crowd - <a href="http://dlinsin.blogspot.com/2008/01/wonderful-checked-exceptions.html" rel="nofollow">including myself</a> - is trying to avoid checked Exceptions. They are trying to work their way around being forced to catch Exceptions by using <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html" rel="nofollow">RuntimeExceptions</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with John Downey.</p>

<p>Personally, I sometimes use a flagged enumeration of permissions. This way you can use AND, OR, NOT and XOR bitwise operations on the enumeration's items.</p>

<pre><code>"[Flags]<br>public enum Permission<br>{<br>    VIEWUSERS = 1, // 2^0 // 0000 0001<br>    EDITUSERS = 2, // 2^1 // 0000 0010<br>    VIEWPRODUCTS = 4, // 2^2 // 0000 0100<br>    EDITPRODUCTS = 8, // 2^3 // 0000 1000<br>    VIEWCLIENTS = 16, // 2^4 // 0001 0000<br>    EDITCLIENTS = 32, // 2^5 // 0010 0000<br>    DELETECLIENTS = 64, // 2^6 // 0100 0000<br>}"<br></code></pre>

<p>Then, you can combine several permissions using the AND bitwise operator. <br><br>
For example, if a user can view &amp; edit users, the binary result of the operation is 0000 0011 which converted to decimal is 3. <br>
You can then store the permission of one user into a single column of your DataBase (in our case it would be 3).<br><br>
Inside your application, you just need another bitwise operation (OR) to verify if a user has a particular permission or not. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell Python, up through 2.5, only supports hexadecimal &amp; octal literals.  I did find some discussions about adding binary to future versions but nothing definite.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this is one of the things due to change in Python 3.0 with perhaps bin() to go with hex() and oct().</p>

<p>EDIT:
lbrandy's answer is correct in all cases.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print int('01010101111',2)
687
&gt;&gt;&gt; print int('11111111',2)
255
</code></pre>

<p>Another way.</p>

<p>In addition to John Downey and jdecuyper's solutions, I've also added an "Explicit Deny" bit at the end/beginning of the bitfield, so that you can perform additive permissions by group, role membership, and then subtract permissions based upon explicit deny entries, much like NTFS works, permission-wise.</p>
<p>In general this is a very subtle issue and note trivial whatsoever. I encourage you to read <a href="http://mysqlperformanceblog.com">mysqlperformanceblog.com</a> and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596101716">High Performance MySQL</a>. I really think there is no general answer for this.</p>

<p>I'm working on a project which has a MySQL database with almost 1TB of data. The most important scalability factor is RAM. If the indexes of your tables fit into memory and your queries are highly optimized, you can serve a reasonable amount of requests with a average machine. </p>

<p>The number of records do matter, depending of how your tables look like. It's a difference to have a lot of varchar fields or only a couple of ints or longs.</p>

<p>The physical size of the database matters as well: think of backups, for instance. Depending on your engine, your physical db files on grow, but don't shrink, for instance with innodb. So deleting a lot of rows, doesn't help to shrink your physical files.</p>

<p>There's a lot to this issues and as in a lot of cases the devil is in the details.</p>

<p>I have to agree with the OP 'wrong' dates really jar with my DD/MM/YYYY upbringing and I find ISO 8601 dates and times extremely easy to work with.  For once the standard got it right and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/761/#770" rel="nofollow">engtech</a> has the obvious answer that doesn't require localisation.</p>

<p>I was going to report the birthday input form on stack overflow as a bug because of how much of a sore thumb it is to the majority of the world.</p>
<P>Also watch out for complex joins. Transaction complexity can be a big factor in addition to transaction volume.</P>
<P>Refactoring heavy queries sometimes offers a big performance boost.</P>
<p>From the Apple Developer Connection Safari Web Content Guide for iPhone page <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/OptimizingforSafarioniPhone/chapter_3_section_4.html" rel="nofollow">Specifying a Webpage Icon for Web Clip</a>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user can add a web application or
  webpage link to the Home screen. These
  links, represented by an icon, are
  called web clips. Follow these simple
  steps to specify an icon to represent
  your web application or webpage on
  iPhone.</p>
  
  <p>To specify an icon for the entire
  website (every page on the website),
  place an icon file in PNG format in
  the root document folder called
  apple-touch-icon.png.</p>
  
  <p>To specify an icon for a single
  webpage, or replace the website icon
  with a webpage-specific icon, add a
  link element to the webpage as in:</p>
  
  <p><code>&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/custom_icon.png"/&gt;</code></p>
  
  <p>In the above example, replace
  custom_icon.png with your icon
  filename.</p>
  
  <p>See "Create an Icon for Your Web
  Application or Webpage" in iPhone

  Human Interface Guidelines for webpage
  icon metrics.</p>
  
  <p>Note: The web clip feature is
  available in iPhone 1.1.3 and later.</p>

<p>From some of the initial research it doesn't appear to be a super simple solution. </p>

<p>It appears that doing this involves having Visual Studio 2008 actually installed on the continuous integration server, which could be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Then configure the MSTest.exe to run in the tasks list, but first you'll have to make a batch file to delete the results files from previous passes as this file's existence causes an error.</p>

<p>Then create a xslt to format the results and put it into the dashboard.config file.</p>

<p>The code project article I found has a lot more detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/tips/VSTS2008_Tests_With_CCNET.aspx" rel="nofollow">Integrating Visual Studio Team System 2008 Unit Tests with CruiseControl.NET</a></p>

<p>You should be able to check out the current version of the code and then create a git repository around it. Updating that and committing it to your local git repository should be painless. As should cloning it.</p>

<p>The only catch is that you need to have them both ignore each other (I've done something similar with SVN) by messing with the appropriate ignore files. I'm presuming SourceSafe let's you ignore things. And you'll need to do certain operations twice (like telling both that you are deleting a file).</p>
<p><strong>MacVim</strong> works well and certainly looks more mature than Vim-Cocoa, moreover there is a Cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for MacVim (and someone is already working on a TextMate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ IMHO).</p>

<p>There was also a Carbon version of Vim, but this didn't offer a great deal over the Terminal version. i.e. only allowed one window open, not very OSX in appearance...</p>

<p><strong>Aquamacs</strong> is very usable and looks pretty good. Supports both traditional Mac OS style keyboard shortcuts (command-O, command-S) and the Control/Meta shortcuts for those raised on traditional Emacs. It is definitely more Mac-like than Carbon Emacs. It seems stable and fast, but I am not an Emacs guru so I don't stress it all that much when I use it. I can't speak to the extensiveness of the included elisp packages, either.</p>

<p>Someone syncs Carbon Emacs with the upstream tree quarterly I think. Aquamacs has a more irregular schedule, but it's seen some pretty major updates over the last year.</p>

<p><strong>GNU Emacs</strong> for OSX can be found at <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com" rel="nofollow">emacsformacosx.com</a>. In addition to the latest stable release, there are also pre-release test builds and nightly builds, and Atom feeds are provided for tracking all three release types.</p>

<p>I've made a suggestion that Stack Overflow implement an apple-touch-icon:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/15237" rel="nofollow">Add an apple-touch-icon for Safari on iPhone</a></p>
<p>A short form is convenient and helps avoid spelling mistakes. Localize as applicable, but be sure to display the expected format (do not leave the user blind). Provide a date-picker control as an <em>optional</em> aide to filling in the field.</p>

<p>As an extra, on-the-fly parsing and display of the date in long form might help too.</p>
<P>Well... KernelTrap has <A href="http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2008/5/27/1952124" rel="nofollow">something on this</A>. Looks like you can use <A href="http://www.pumacode.org/projects/vss2svn/wiki/RunningTheMigration" rel="nofollow">vss2svn</A> to pipe the Source Safe repo into a Subversion repository, then use the very nice git-svn to pull into a local git repo.</P>
<P>I would assume the commits back to VSS would not be a smooth, automatic process using this method.</P>
<p>While I would still like an answer to why my JS wasn't being recognized, the solution I found in the meantime (and should have done in the first place) is to use an Asp:CompareValidator instead of an Asp:CustomValidator.</p>
<p>While you cannot prevent usage of those inherited members to my knowledge, you should be able to hide them from IntelliSense using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.editorbrowsableattribute.aspx">EditorBrowsableAttribute</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Using System.ComponentModel;

[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
private string MyHiddenString = "Muahahahahahahahaha";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Just saw this in the documentation comments, which makes it kinda useless for this purpose:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a prominent note that states that this attribute "does not suppress members from a class in the same assembly". That is true but not complete. Actually, the attribute does not suppress members from a class in the same solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you're best least hackish way is to consider composition as opposed to inheritance.</p>

<p>Or, you could create an interface that has the members you want, have your derived class implement that interface, and program against the interface.</p>
<p>One potential thing you can do is contain the object rather than extend from the other class.  This will give you the most flexibility in terms of exposing what you want to expose, but if you absolutely need the object to be of that type it is not the ideal solution (however you could expose the object from a getter).</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass : BaseClass<br>{<br>    // Your stuff here<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass<br>{<br>    private BaseClass baseClass;<br><br>    public void ExposeThisMethod()<br>    {<br>        baseClass.ExposeThisMethod();<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass<br>{<br>    private BaseClass baseClass;<br><br>    public BaseClass BaseClass<br>    {<br>        get<br>        {<br>            return baseClass;<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>
<P>If you use Visual Studio you can use Visual C++ 2008 Feature Pack Release, this implements some of TR1, and includes regular expression parsing. <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&amp;displaylang=en">Get it</A></P>
<p>Some time ago I wrote a quick and dirty exe that would update the version #'s in an assemblyinfo.{cs/vb} - I also have used rxfind.exe (a simple and powerful regex-based search replace tool) to do the update from a command line as part of the build process.  A couple of other helpfule hints:</p>

<ol>
<li>separate the assemblyinfo into product parts (company name, version, etc.) and assembly specific parts (assembly name etc.).  See <a href="http://blog.darrenstokes.com/2007/12/17/ease-versioning-multiple-assemblies-by-splitting-up-assemblyinfo/" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li>Also - i use subversion, so I found it helpful to set the build number to subversion revision number thereby making it really easy to always get back to the codebase that generated the assembly (e.g. 1.4.100.1502 was built from revision 1502).</li>
</ol>
<p>Just wondering, what do you feel your method leaves to be desired?  You could replace the anonymous delegate with a.. named? delegate, something like</p>

<pre><code>    public delegate void IoOperation(params string[] parameters);<br><br>    public void FileDeleteOperation(params string[] fileName)<br>    {<br>        File.Delete(fileName[0]);<br>    }<br><br>    public void FileCopyOperation(params string[] fileNames)<br>    {<br>        File.Copy(fileNames[0], fileNames[1]);<br>    }<br><br>    public void RetryFileIO(IoOperation operation, params string[] parameters)<br>    {<br>        RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));<br>        bool success = false;<br>        while (!success)<br>        {<br>            try<br>            {<br>                operation(parameters);<br>                success = true;<br>            }<br>            catch (IOException e)<br>            {<br>                if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)<br>                {<br>                    throw;<br>                }<br>                fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();<br>            }<br>        }<br>    }<br><br>    public void Foo()<br>    {<br>        this.RetryFileIO(FileDeleteOperation, "L:\file.to.delete" );<br>        this.RetryFileIO(FileCopyOperation, "L:\file.to.copy.source", "L:\file.to.copy.destination" );<br>    }<br></code></pre>
<p>Override them like Michael Suggests <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1528/#1533" rel="nofollow">above</a> and to prevent folks from using the overridden (sp?) methods, mark them as obsolete:</p>

<pre><code>[Obsolete("These are not supported in this class.", true)]<br>public override  void dontcallmeanymore()<br>{<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>If the second parm is set to true, a compiler error will be generated if anyone tries to  call that method and the string in the first parm is the message.  If parm2 is false only a compiler warning will be generated.</p>

<p>This has already been answered for Java, here's the C# answer:</p>

<p>"Integer" is not a valid type name in C# and "int" is just an alias for System.Int32. Also, unlike in Java (or C++) there aren't any special primitive types in C#, every instance of a type in C# (including int) is an object. Here's some demonstrative code:</p>

<pre><code>void DoStuff()<br>{<br>    System.Console.WriteLine( SomeMethod((int)5) );<br>    System.Console.WriteLine( GetTypeName&lt;int&gt;() );<br>}<br><br>string SomeMethod(object someParameter)<br>{<br>    return string.Format("Some text {0}", someParameter.ToString());<br>}<br><br>string GetTypeName&lt;T&gt;()<br>{<br>    return (typeof (T)).FullName;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>There is a good article on <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/2803-introducing-xdebug">Zend Developer Zone</a> (installing on Linux doesn't seem any easier) and even a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/3960">Firefox plugin</a>, which I never used.</p>

<p>A while ago I found a windows port of all the popular linux commands I use (ls, grep, diff) and I simply unzip those to a file, add it to my PATH environment and then can run from there: <a href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>If you're referring to simply accessing your IIS server from a remote location, remote desktop generally solves that problem.  Assuming your server has a static IP address or a host name you can access from the internet, remote desktop is a simple and relatively secure solution.</p>

<p>I don't think there is a "correct size". Since the iPhone really is running OSX, the icon rendering system is pretty robust. As long as you give it a high-quality image with the right aspect ratio and a resolution at least as high as the actual output will be, the OS will downscale very cleanly. My site uses a 158x158 and the icon looks pixel-perfect on the iPhone screen.</p>
<p>In all honesty, a combination of print and print_r() to print out the variables. I know that many prefer to use other more advanced methods but I find this the easiest to use.</p>

<p>I will say that I didn't fully appreciate this until I did some Microprocessor programming at Uni and was not able to use even this.</p>
<p>The best way I can think of would be to use <strong>Cygwin</strong> over an <strong>OpenSSH</strong> connection.
Here's a document that explains how to do just that: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cert/openssh_rdp_vnc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cert/openssh_rdp_vnc.pdf</a></p>
<p>Depends on how much detail you want it to have, it needs to have the aspect ratio of 1:1 (basically - it needs to be square)</p>

<p>I would go with the Apple's own 129*129</p>
<p>I would check both IP and User Agent to see if they change</p>

<pre><code>if ($_SESSION['user_agent'] != $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']<br>    || $_SESSION['user_ip'] != $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'])<br>{<br>    //Something fishy is going on here?<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>It is possible to skip the step of creating the empty database. You can create the new database as part of the restore process.</p>

<p>This is actually the easiest and best way I know of to clone a database. You can eliminate errors by scripting the backup and restore process rather than running it through the SQL Server Management Studio</p>

<p>There are two other options you could explore:</p>

<ol>
<li>Detach the database, copy the .mdf file and re-attach.</li>
<li>Use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to copy all the objects over</li>
</ol>

<p>I suggest sticking with backup and restore and automating if necessary.</p>
<p>MySQLdb is what I have used before.</p>

<p>If you host is using Python version 2.5 or higher, support for sqlite3 databases is built in (sqlite allows you to have a relational database that is simply a file in your filesystem).  But buyer beware, sqlite is not suited for production, so it may depend what you are trying to do with it.</p>

<p>Another option may be to call your host and complain, or change hosts.  Honestly these days, any self respecting web host that supports python and mysql ought to have MySQLdb pre installed.</p>
<p>@ Mark Harrison : SQL Server does not support that syntax (<code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>).</p>

<p>The SQL Server equivalent is the <code>SELECT</code> statement hint <code>UPDLOCK</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187373.aspx" rel="nofollow">SQL Server Books Online</a> for more information.</p>

<P>You can not do this programatically (in a safe way that is) without creating a new table. </P>
<P>What Enterprise Manager does when you commit a reordering is to create a new table, move the data and then delete the old table and rename the new table to the existing name. </P>
<P>If you want your columns in a particular order/grouping without altering their physical order, you can create a view which can be whatever you desire.</P>
<p>When Management Studio does it, it's creating a temporary table, copying everything across, dropping your original table and renaming the temporary table.  There's no simple equivalent T-SQL statement.</p>

<p>If you don't fancy doing that, you could always create a view of the table with the columns in the order you'd like and use that?</p>

<p>Edit: beaten!</p>
<p>I may be old fashioned, but I prefer my text editor.  </p>

<p>I use emacs, and it has a fairly decent xml mode.  </p>

<p>Most good text editors will have decent syntax hi-lighting and tag matching facilities.  Your IDE might already do it (IntelliJ idea does, and I believe Eclipse does as well).  Good text editors will be able to deal with <em>huge</em> files, but some text editors may not be able to handle them.  How big are we talking about?</p>
<p>If the encoding is <strong>base64</strong> then this is the solution I've stumbled upon on the web <a href="http://www.suares.an/" rel="nofollow">link</a> :</p>

<p>"Decoding XDFL files saved with 'encoding=base64'.
Files saved with: </p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.xfdl;content-encoding="base64-gzip"<br></code></pre>

<p>are simple base64-encoded gzip files. They can be easily restored to XML by first decoding and then unzipping them. This can be done as follows on Ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install uudeview uudeview -i yourform.xfdl gunzip -S "" &lt; UNKNOWN.001 &gt; yourform-unpacked.xfdl <br></code></pre>

<p>The first command will install uudeview, a package that can decode base64, among others. You can skip this step once it is installed.</p>

<p>Assuming your form is saved as 'yourform.xfdl', the uudeview command will decode the contents as 'UNKNOWN.001', since the xfdl file doesn't contain a file name. The '-i' option makes uudeview uninteractive, remove that option for more control.</p>

<p>The last command gunzips the decoded file into a file named 'yourform-unpacked.xfdl'.
"</p>

<p><em>Side Note: Block quoted &lt; code &gt; doesn't work for long strings of code</em></p>
<p>I usually do a project for the GUI a project for the business logic a project for data access and a project for unit tests.</p>

<p>But sometimes it is prudent to have separation based upon services (if you are using a service oriented architecture) Such as Authentication, Sales, etc. </p>

<p>I guess the rule of thumb that I work off of is that if you can see it as a component that has a clear separation of concerns then a different project could be prudent. But I would think that folders versus projects could just be a preference or philosophy.</p>

<p>I personally feel that if reusable code is split into projects it is simpler to use other places than if it is just in folders.</p>
<p>Here's a dynamic sql script I've used in the past.  It can be further modified but it will give you the basics.  I prefer scripting it to avoid the mistakes you can make using the Management Studio:</p>

<p>It's kinda low tech, and there might be a better solution out there, but you could just store your schema in an SQL script which can be run to create the database.  I think you can execute a command to generate this script, but I don't know the command unfortunately.</p>

<p>Then, commit the script into source control along with the code that works on it.  When you need to change the schema along with the code, the script can be checked in along with the code that requires the changed schema.  Then, diffs on the script will indicate diffs on schema changes.</p>

<p>With this script, you could integrate it with DBUnit or some kind of build script, so it seems it could fit in with your already automated processes.</p>

It's cross-platform and has a graphical schema editor, but since I use DTDs and not schemas, I can't vouch for the schema editor's quality.  The rest of the editing package (such as the XML editor and XSLT debugger) is solid, so it could be worth a try.</p>

  <p>I personally feel that if reusable code is split into projects it is simpler to use other places than if it is just in folders.</p>

<p>I really agree with this - if you can reuse it, it should be in a separate project.  With that said, it's also very difficult to reuse effectively :)</p>

<p>Here at SO, we've tried to be very simple with three projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>MVC Web project (which does a nice job of separating your layers into folders by default)</li>
<li>Database project for source control of our DB</li>
<li>Unit tests against MVC models/controllers</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't speak for everyone, but I'm happy with how simple we've kept it - really speeds the builds along!</p>
<p>In the Rails world, there's the concept of migrations, scripts in which changes to the database are made in Ruby rather than a database-specific flavour of SQL. Your Ruby migration code ends up being converted into the DDL specific to your current database; this makes switching database platforms very easy. </p>

<p>For every change you make to the database, you write a new migration. Migrations typically have two methods: an "up" method in which the changes are applied and a "down" method in which the changes are undone. A single command brings the database up to date, and can also be used to bring the database to a specific version of the schema. In Rails, migrations are kept in their own directory in the project directory and get checked into version control just like any other project code.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/kern-rails-migrations.html" rel="nofollow" title="Oracle guide to Ruby on Rails migrations">This Oracle guide to Rails migrations</a> covers migrations quite well.</p>

<p>Developers using other languages have looked at migrations and have implemented their own language-specific versions. I know of <strong><a href="https://github.com/ruckus/ruckusing-migrations" rel="nofollow" title="Ruckusing">Ruckusing</a></strong>, a PHP migrations system that is modelled after Rails' migrations; it might be what you're looking for.</p>

<p>By default, <strong>always just create new folder</strong> within the same project</p>

<ul>
<li>You will get single assembly (without additional ILMerge gymnastic)</li>
<li>Easier to obfuscate (because you will have less public types and methods, ideally none at all)</li>
</ul>

<p>Separating your source code into multiple projects makes only sense if you...</p>

<ul>
<li>Have some portions of the source code that are part of the project but not deployable by default or at all (unit tests, extra plugins etc.)</li>
<li>More developers involved and you want to treat their work as consumable black box. (not very recommended)</li>
<li>If you can clearly separate your project into isolated layers/modules and you want to make sure that they can't cross-consume <strong>internal</strong> members. (also not recommended because you will need to decide which aspect is the most important)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think that some portions of your source code could be reusable, still don't create it as a new project. Just wait until you will really want to reuse it in another solution and isolate it out of original project as needed. Programming is not a lego, reusing is usually very difficult and often won't happen as planned.</p>
<p>If you are using C#, have a look at Subsonic, a very useful ORM tool, but is also generates sql script to recreated your scheme and\or data. These scripts can then be put into source control.</p>

<p>If you are quite happy with MSBuild, then I would stick with MSBuild.  This may be one of those cases where the tool you learn first is the one you will prefer.  I started with NAnt and can't quite get used to MSBuild.  I'm sure they will both be around for quite some time.</p>

<p>There are some fundamental differences between the two, probably best highlighted by <a href="http://forums.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/msbuild/thread/994761a3-ea9d-40c7-8d4f-4c208b2023f6/">this conversation between some NAnt fans and a Microsoftie</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx">Jeremy Miller</a> asked the exact opposite question <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/09/20/is-there-a-good-reason-to-switch-to-msbuild.aspx">on his blog</a> last year.  </p>
<p><a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/" rel="nofollow">"Let's Build a Compiler"</a> is awesome, but it's a bit outdated. (I'm not saying it makes it even a little bit less valid.)</p>

<p>Or check out <a href="https://www.quora.com/As-a-self-taught-programmer-how-can-I-learn-about-compilers/answer/Akhil-Kooliyatt?srid=TAGM" rel="nofollow">SLANG</a>. This is similar to "Let's Build a Compiler" but is a much better resource especially for beginners. This comes with a pdf tutorial which takes a 7 step approach at teaching you a compiler. Adding the quora link as it have the links to all the various ports of SLANG, in C++, Java and JS, also  interpreters in python and java, originally written using C# and the .NET platform.</p>

<p>I'm not necessarily looking for the fastest but a nice balance, some of the server that this code is being developed for are fairly slow, the script that hashes and stores the password is taking 5-6 seconds to run, and I've narrowed it down to the hashing (if I comment the hashing out it runs, in 1-2 seconds).</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be the MOST secure, I'm not codding for a bank (right now) but I certainly <strong><em>WILL NOT</em></strong> store the passwords as plain-text.</p>
<p>I concur with the Dragon Book reference; IMO, it is the definitive guide to compiler construction. Get ready for some hardcore theory, though.</p>

<p>If you want a book that is lighter on theory, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1931841578">Game Scripting Mastery</a> might be a better book for you. If you are a total newbie at compiler theory, it provides a gentler introduction. It doesn't cover more practical parsing methods (opting for non-predictive recursive descent without discussing LL or LR parsing), and as I recall, it doesn't even discuss any sort of optimization theory. Plus, instead of compiling to machine code, it compiles to a bytecode that is supposed to run on a VM that you also write.</p>

<p>It's still a decent read, particularly if you can pick it up for cheap on Amazon. If you only want an easy introduction into compilers, Game Scripting Mastery is not a bad way to go. If you want to go hardcore up front, then you should settle for nothing less than the Dragon Book.</p>
<p>In my experience its best to keep an the info in the profile to a bare minimum, only put the essentials in there that are directly needed for authentication. Other information such as addresses should be saved in your own database by your own application logic, this approach is more extensible and maintainable.</p>
<p>I think that depends on how many fields you need. To my knowledge, Profiles are essentially a long string that gets split at the given field sizes, which means that they do not scale very well if you have many fields and users.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they are built in, so it's an easy and standardized way, which means there is not a big learning curve and you can use it in future apps as well without needing to tweak it to a new table structure.</p>

<p>Rolling your own thing allows you to put it in a properly normalized database, which drastically improves performance, but you have to write pretty much all the profile managing code yourself.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, Profiles are not cached, so every access to a profile goes to the database first (it's then cached for that request, but the next request will get it from the database again)</p>

<p>If you're thinking about writing your own thing, maybe a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0580x1f5%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">custom Profile Provider</a> gives you the best of both worlds - seamless integration, yet the custom stuff you want to do.</p>
<p>If you're looking to use powerful, higher level tools rather than building <em>everything</em> yourself, going through the projects and readings for <a href="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/CS652/CS652+Home">this course</a> is a pretty good option.  It's a languages course by the author of the Java parser engine ANTLR.  You can get the book for the course as a PDF from <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr/the-definitive-antlr-reference">the Pragmatic Programmers</a>.</p>

<p>The course goes over the standard compiler compiler stuff that you'd see elsewhere: parsing, types and type checking, polymorphism, symbol tables, and code generation.  Pretty much the only thing that isn't covered is optimizations.  The final project is  a program that <a href="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/CS652/C+subset+compiler">compiles a subset of C</a>.  Because you use tools like ANTLR and LLVM, it's feasible to write the entire compiler in a single day (I have an existence proof of this, though I do mean ~24 hours).  It's heavy on practical engineering using modern tools, a bit lighter on theory.</p>

<p>LLVM, by the way, is simply fantastic.  Many situations where you might normally compile down to assembly, you'd be much better off compiling to <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM's Intermediate Representation</a> instead.  It's higher level, cross platform, and LLVM is quite good at generating optimized assembly from it.</p>
<p>The active projects on <a href="http://rubyforge.org/top/mostactive.php?type=week" rel="nofollow">Rubyforge</a> are a great place to start.  What would be a good starter project is to pick one that is pretty popular but not a lot of developers.</p>

<p>If you are interested in Ruby on Rails, I'm working on <a href="http://www.redmine.org" rel="nofollow">Redmine</a> right now.  It's been one of the most active projects and only has 5 developers.  <a href="http://www.opensourcerails.com/" rel="nofollow">Open Source Rails</a> also has a good collection of projects.</p>

<p>I've found doing a <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2008/05/23/refactotum-overview" rel="nofollow">Refactotum</a> a great way to get started on a project.  Use the fact that you are new to your advantage, most people who have been on a project forget about simple things like gem dependencies and documentation</p>

<p><a href="http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch13-2wy.html" rel="nofollow">This website</a> might help you out a bit more.  Also <a href="http://www.unesco.org/webworld/idams/advguide/Chapt4_3.htm" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I'm working from a fairly rusty memory of a statistics course, but here goes nothing:</p>

<p>When you're doing analysis of variance (ANOVA), you actually calculate the F statistic as the ratio from the mean-square variances "between the groups" and the mean-square variances "within the groups".  The second link above seems pretty good for this calculation.</p>

<p>This makes the F statistic measure exactly how powerful your model is, because the "between the groups" variance is explanatory power, and "within the groups" variance is random error.  High F implies a highly significant model.</p>

<p>As in many statistical operations, you back-determine Sig. using the F statistic.  Here's where your Wikipedia information comes in slightly handy.  What you want to do is - using the degrees of freedom given to you by SPSS - find the proper P value at which an <a href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/%7Esharov/PopEcol/tables/f005.html" rel="nofollow">F table</a> will give you the F statistic you calculated.  The P value where this happens [F(table) = F(calculated)] is the significance.</p>

<p>Conceptually, a lower significance value shows a very strong ability to reject the null hypothesis (which for these purposes means to determine your model has explanatory power).</p>

<p>Sorry to any math folks if any of this is wrong.  I'll be checking back to make edits!!!</p>

<p>Good luck to you.  Stats is fun, just maybe not this part.  =)</p>

<p>This is very easy to do in java, and as stated above you can reach into the java.util.zip libraries from C#.  For references see:</p>

<p>I used this a while ago to do a deep (recursive) zip of a folder structure, but I don't think I ever used the unzipping.  If I'm so motivated I may pull that code out and edit it into here later.</p>
<p>This is my take on it. I would say unit testing is the practice of writing software tests to verify that your real software does what it is meant to. This started with <a href="http://junit.org/" rel="nofollow">jUnit</a> in the Java world and has become a best practice in PHP as well with <a href="http://simpletest.org/" rel="nofollow">SimpleTest</a> and <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/" rel="nofollow">phpUnit</a>. It's a core practice of Extreme Programming and helps you to be sure that your software still works as intended after editing. If you have sufficient test coverage, you can do major refactoring, bug fixing or add features rapidly with much less fear of introducing other problems.</p>

<p>It's most effective when all unit tests can be run automatically.</p>

<p>Unit testing is generally associated with OO development. The basic idea is to create a script which sets up the environment for your code and then exercises it; you write assertions, specify the intended output that you should receive and then execute your test script using a framework such as those mentioned above.</p>

<p>The framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test. phpUnit is run from the Linux command line by default, though there are HTTP interfaces available for it. SimpleTest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running, IMO. In combination with xDebug, phpUnit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful.</p>

<p>Some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes.</p>

<p>It's good practice to keep your unit tests in the same repository as your application.</p>
<p>I'd suggest against passing an integer between them, simply for purposes of readability and debugging.  Say you're going through your logs and you see a bunch of 500 errors for DocumentType=4.  Now you've got to go look up which DocumentType is 4.  Or if one of the applications refers to a number that doesn't exist in the other, perhaps due to mismatched versions.</p>

<p>It's a bit more code, and it rubs the static typing part of the brain a bit raw, but in protocols on top of HTTP the received wisdom is to side with legible strings over opaque enumerations.</p>
<p>I can only speak about .net, but if you have an ASP.net Webservice, you should be able to add an enumeration directly to it.</p>

<p>When you then use the "Add Web Reference" in your Client Application, the resulting Class should include that enum</p>

<p>But this is from the top of my head, i'm pretty sure i've done it in the past, but I can't say for sure.</p>
<p>I would still use enumeration internally but would expect consumers to pass me only the name, not the numeric value itself.</p>

<p>just some silly example to illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>public enum DocumentType<br>{<br>  Invoice,<br>  Contract,<br>  WorkOrder,<br>  SignedWorkOrder<br>}<br><br>[WebMethod]<br>public void UploadDocument(string type, byte[] data)<br>{<br>  DocumentType docType = (DocumentType)Enum.Parse(typeof(DocumentType), type);<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>You need to put the match in parentheses, like this:</p>

<pre><code>preg_replace("/([A-Z])/", "&lt;span class=\"initial\"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;", $str)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought I'd give this a shot using classes and polymorphism. I had a previous iteration which used sub-classing which ended up having way too much overhead. I've switched to a more flexible delegate / public property object model which is significantly better. My code is very slightly more accurate, I wish I could come up with a better way to generate "months ago" that didn't seem too over-engineered.</p>

<p>I think I'd still stick with Jeff's if-then cascade because it's less code and it's simpler (it's definitely easier to ensure it'll work as expected).</p>

<p>For the below code <em>PrintRelativeTime.GetRelativeTimeMessage(TimeSpan ago)</em> returns the relative time message (e.g. "yesterday").</p>

<pre><code>public class RelativeTimeRange : IComparable<br>{<br>    public TimeSpan UpperBound { get; set; }<br><br>    public delegate string RelativeTimeTextDelegate(TimeSpan timeDelta);<br><br>    public RelativeTimeTextDelegate MessageCreator { get; set; }<br><br>    public int CompareTo(object obj)<br>    {<br>        if (!(obj is RelativeTimeRange))<br>        {<br>            return 1;<br>        }<br>        // note that this sorts in reverse order to the way you'd expect, <br>        // this saves having to reverse a list later<br>        return (obj as RelativeTimeRange).UpperBound.CompareTo(UpperBound);<br>    }<br>}<br><br>public class PrintRelativeTime<br>{<br>    private static List&lt;RelativeTimeRange&gt; timeRanges;<br><br>    static PrintRelativeTime()<br>    {<br>        timeRanges = new List&lt;RelativeTimeRange&gt;{<br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return "one second ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return delta.Seconds + " seconds ago"; }<br><br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return "one minute ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return delta.Minutes + " minutes ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromHours(2),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return "one hour ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromHours(24),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return delta.Hours + " hours ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.FromDays(2),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return "yesterday"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = DateTime.Now.Subtract(DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1)),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return delta.Days + " days ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = DateTime.Now.Subtract(DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-2)),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return "one month ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = DateTime.Now.Subtract(DateTime.Now.AddYears(-1)),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return (int)Math.Floor(delta.TotalDays / 30) + " months ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = DateTime.Now.Subtract(DateTime.Now.AddYears(-2)),<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return "one year ago"; }<br>            }, <br>            new RelativeTimeRange<br>            {<br>                UpperBound = TimeSpan.MaxValue,<br>                MessageCreator = (delta) =&gt; <br>                { return (int)Math.Floor(delta.TotalDays / 365.24D) + " years ago"; }<br>            }<br>        };<br><br>        timeRanges.Sort();<br>    }<br><br>    public static string GetRelativeTimeMessage(TimeSpan ago)<br>    {<br>        RelativeTimeRange postRelativeDateRange = timeRanges[0];<br><br>        foreach (var timeRange in timeRanges)<br>        {<br>            if (ago.CompareTo(timeRange.UpperBound) &lt;= 0)<br>            {<br>                postRelativeDateRange = timeRange;<br>            }<br>        }<br><br>        return postRelativeDateRange.MessageCreator(ago);<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/" rel="nofollow">MbUnit</a>, er, <a href="http://www.gallio.org/" rel="nofollow">Gallio</a>.  Most importantly to me is having good tools support inside Visual Studio.  For that I use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html" rel="nofollow">Resharper</a>, which has an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mbunit-resharper/" rel="nofollow">MbUnit test runner</a>.

<p>This is broken because 'false' as a string will evaluate to true as a boolean.</p>

<p>However, this is an unneeded ternary expression, because the resulting values are simple true and false.  This would be equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>$canMerge = ($condition1 &amp;&amp; $condition2);<br></code></pre>
<p>The exact definitions of "vsize," "rss," "rprvt," "rshrd," and other obscure-looking abbreviations vary from OS to OS.  The manual pages for the "top" and "ps" commands will have some sort of description, but all such descriptions are simplified greatly (or are based on long-extinct kernel implementations).  "Process size" as a concept is fiendishly difficult to pin down in the general case.  Answers in specific instances depend heavily on the actual memory management implementation in the OS, and are rarely as satisfying as the tidy "process size" concept that exists in the minds of most users (and most developers).</p>

<p>For example, none of those numbers (nor, likely, any combination of them) can be used to tell you exactly how many such processes can run at once in a given amount of free memory.  But really, your best bet is to come at it from that end: why do you want this number, and what will you use it for?  Given that information, I think you'll get more useful answers.</p>

<p>@Peter Coulton -- you don't read Knuth, you study it.</p>

<p>For me, and my work... <em>Purely Functional Data Structures</em> is great for thinking and developing with functional languages in mind.</p>
<P>In .NET, enumeration values are (by default) serialized into xml with the name. For instances where you can have multiple values (<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.flagsattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">flags</A>), then it puts a space between the values. This works because the enumeration doesn't contain spaces, so you can get the value again by splitting the string (ie. "Invoice Contract SignedWorkOrder", using lubos's example).</P>
<P>You can control the serialization of values of in asp.net web services using the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlenumattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">XmlEnumAttribute</A>, or using the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.enummemberattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">EnumMember</A> attribute when using WCF.</P>
<p>Backup and Restore is the most straight-forward way I know.  You have to be careful between servers as security credentials don't come with the restored database.</p>

<p>If you are consuming your Web service from a .NET page/application, you should be able to access the enumeration after you add your Web reference to the project that is consuming the service.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php">preg_replace documentation</a> on php.net:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>replacement</em>  may contain references of

  with the latter form being the
  preferred one. Every such reference
  will be replaced by the text captured

<p><em>@Dillie-O: Your answer put me in the right direction (I should have expected it to just be a registry change) and I got this working. But I'm going to mark this as the answer because I'm going to put some additional information that I found while working on this.</em>  </p>

<p>The solution to this question really doesn't matter what programming language you're using, as long as there's some way to modify Windows registry settings.</p>

<p>Finally, here's the answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>To associate a program with the mailto protocol for <strong>all users</strong> on a computer, change the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command Default value to:<br>
"<em>Your program's executable</em>" "%1"</li>
<li>To <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/permail.htm">associate a program with the mailto protocol for the <strong>current user</strong></a>, change the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\mailto\shell\open\command Default value to:<br>
"<em>Your program's executable</em>" "%1"</li>
</ul>

<p>The %1 will be replaced with the entire mailto URL. For example, given the link:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="mailto:user@example.com"&gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The following will be executed:<br>
"<em>Your program's executable</em>" "mailto:user@example.com"</p>

<P>I like <A href="http://www.testdriven.net/overview.aspx" rel="nofollow">TestDriven.NET</A> (even though I use ReSharper) and I'm pretty happy with <A href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit" rel="nofollow">XUnit.net</A>. It uses Facts instead of Tests which many people dislike but I like the difference in terminology.

<p>There are so many it's crazy.  Crazy good, I guess.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the conservative types (me), <a href="http://www.nunit.org/"><strong>NUnit</strong></a> is still available and still more than capable.</li>
<li>For the Microsoft-types, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx"><strong>MSTest</strong></a> is adequate, but slow and clunky compared to Nunit.  It also lacks code coverage without paying the big bucks for the pricey versions of Visual Studio.</li>
<li>There's also <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/About.aspx"><strong>MbUnit</strong></a>.  It's like NUnit, but has nifty features like RowTest (run the same test with different parameters) and Rollback (put the database back like you found it after a test) </li>
<li>And finally, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xunit"><strong>xUnit.net</strong></a> is the trendy option with some attitude.</li>
<li>Oh, and <a href="http://testdriven.net/"><strong>TestDriven.NET</strong></a> will give you IDE integration for both Nunit and MBunit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure they're all just fine.  I'd steer away from MSTest though, unless you just enjoy the convenience of having everything in one IDE out of the box.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=130">Scott Hanselman</a> has a podcast on this very topic.</p>

<P>This one's not specifically about development, but <A href="http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm" rel="nofollow">Security Now</A> from Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte is an excellent discussion of security issues. I think it's a must-listen for just about any computer user who's concerned about security, and especially for web developers who are responsible both for the security of their site and at least partially responsible for their users' security.</P>

<P>Personally I don't like using the Outlook.Application COM object route, as its security prompts ("An application is attempting to access your contacts. Allow this?", etc.) can cause problems on a server. I also think it would be difficult to accomplish your impersonation-like tasks using Outlook, such as sending mail as a given user.</P>

<p>Try putting the extra text inside the server-side script block and concatenating.</p>

<pre><code>onclick='&lt;%# "ToggleDisplay(""" &amp;  DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") &amp; """);" %&gt;'<br></code></pre>

<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure you could just use double quotes outside the script block as well.</p>
<p>The  reason msvcrt fails in IDLE is because IDLE is not accessing the library that runs msvcrt. Whereas when you run the program natively in cmd.exe it works nicely. For the same reason that your program blows up on Mac and Linux terminals.</p>

<p>But I guess if you're going to be using this specifically for windows, more power to ya.</p>
<p>I had recently similar problem and the only way to solve it was to use plain old HTML codes for single (<code>&amp;#39;</code>) and double quotes (<code>&amp;#34;</code>).  </p>

<p>Source code was total mess of course but it worked.</p>

<p>Try</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id="aShowHide" onclick='ToggleDisplay(&amp;#34;&lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") %&gt;&amp;#34;);'&gt;Show/Hide&lt;/a&gt;

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id="aShowHide" onclick='ToggleDisplay(&amp;#39;&lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "JobCode") %&gt;&amp;#39;);'&gt;Show/Hide&lt;/a&gt;

<p>I create folders named after the build versions and put upgrade and downgrade scripts in there. For example, you could have the following folders: 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2. Each one contains the script that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your database between versions.</p>

<p>Should a client or customer call you with a problem with version 1.0.1 and you are using 1.0.2, bringing the database back to his version will not be a problem.</p>

<p>In your database, create a table called "schema" where you put in the current version of the database. Then writing a program that can upgrade or downgrade your database for you is easy.</p>

<p>Just like Joey said, if you are in a Rails world, use Migrations. :)</p>

<p>A good simple way to do it is to open the file, and read each line into an array, linked list, data-structure-of-your-choice. Be careful about handling the first line though.</p>

<p>This may be over your head, but there seems to be a direct way to access them as well using a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2003/10/01/29964.aspx" rel="nofollow">connection string</a>.</p>

<p>Why not try using Python instead of C# or VB? It has a nice CSV module to import that does all the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1104/#1109">Chris</a>' probably has the best pure answer to the question:</p>

<p>However, I'm curious about the root of the question.  If the user should <em>always</em> wrap the call in a try/catch block, should the user-called function really be throwing exceptions in the first place?</p>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer without more context regarding the code-base in question.  Shooting from the hip, I think the best answer here is to wrap the function up such that the recommended (if not only, depending on the overall exception style of the code) public interface does the try/catch <em>for</em> the user.  If you're just trying to ensure that there are no unhandled exceptions in your code, unit tests and code review are probably the best solution.</p>

<p>You are going to get a lot of strings, that's for sure...</p>

<p><img src="http://www.codecogs.com/eq.latex?%5Csum_%7Bi=x%7D%5Ey%20%7B%20%5Cfrac%7Br%21%7D%7B%7B%28r-i%29%7D%21%7D%20%7D" alt="\sum_{i=x}^y{\frac{r!}{{(r-i)}!}}" title=""> <br>
Where, x and y is how you define them and r is the number of characters we are selecting from --if I am understanding you correctly. You should definitely generate these as needed and not get sloppy and say, generate a powerset and then filter the length of strings.</p>

<p>The following definitely isn't the best way to generate these, but it's an interesting aside, none-the-less.</p>

<p>Knuth (volume 4, fascicle 2, 7.2.1.3) tells us that (s,t)-combination is equivalent to s+1 things taken t at a time with repetition -- an (s,t)-combination is notation used by Knuth that is equal to <img src="http://www.codecogs.com/eq.latex?%7Bt%20%5Cchoose%20%7Bs+t%7D%7D" alt="{t \choose {s+t}" title="">. We can figure this out by first generating each (s,t)-combination in binary form (so, of length (s+t)) and counting the number of 0's to the left of each 1.</p>

<p>10001000011101 --&gt; becomes the permutation: {0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1}</p>

<p>If you can guarantee that there are no commas in the data, then the simplest way would probably be to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.split%28VS.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">String.split</a>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>String[] values = myString.Split(',');<br>myObject.StringField = values[0];<br>myObject.IntField = Int32.Parse(values[1]);<br></code></pre>

<p>There may be libraries you could use to help, but that's probably as simple as you can get.  Just make sure you can't have commas in the data, otherwise you will need to parse it better.</p>
<P>Slightly off topic, but in a similar vein. Have you looked at <A href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html" rel="nofollow">Castle ActiveRecord</A> it is written on top of <A href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html" rel="nofollow">NHibernate</A> and removes the need to spend time creating XML mappings from code to the database.

<p>I listen to the <a href="http://javaposse.com" rel="nofollow">javaposse</a> regularly, they cover mostly Java, but not solely.</p>
<p>the problem is that the sphere can be distorted a number of ways, and having all those points known on the equator, lets say, wont help you map points further away.</p>

<p>You need better 'close' points, then you can assume these three points are on a plane with the fourth and do the interpolation --knowing that the distance of longitudes is a function, not a constant.</p>
<p>Ummm.  Maybe I am missing something about the question here, but if you have long/lat info, you also have the direction of north?</p>

<p>It seems you need to map geodesic coordinates to a projected coordinates system. For example osgb to wgs84.</p>

<p>The maths involved is non-trivial, but the code comes out a only a few lines. If I had more time I'd post more but I need a shower so I will be boring and link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> entry which is pretty good.</p>

<p>Note: Post shower edited.</p>
<p>There are two articles on CodeProject that provide code for a solution, one that uses <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx" rel="nofollow">StreamReader</a> and one that <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/FinalCSVReader.aspx" rel="nofollow">imports CSV data</a> using the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/187670" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Text Driver</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not clear on whether or not you're wanting to add the asynchronous bits to the server in C# or the client in C++.</p>

<p>If you're talking about doing this in C++, desktop Windows platforms can do socket I/O asynchronously through the API's that use overlapped I/O.  For sockets, WSASend, WSARecv both allow async I/O (read the documentation on their LPOVERLAPPED parameters, which you can populate with events that get set when the I/O completes).</p>

<p>I don't know if Windows Mobile platforms support these functions, so you might have to do some additional digging. </p>
<p>The solution is to use the TempData property to store the desired Request components.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Send()
{
    TempData["form"] = Request.Form;
    return this.RedirectToAction(a =&gt; a.Form());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your "Form" action you can go:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Form()
{
    /* Declare viewData etc. */

    if (TempData["form"] != null)
    {
        /* Cast TempData["form"] to 
        System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection 
        and use it */
    }

    return View("Form", viewData);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any more specific details on the kind of distortion?  If, for example, your latitudes and longitudes are "distorted" onto your 2D map using a Mercator projection, the conversion math is <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" rel="nofollow">readily available</a>.</p>

<p>If the map is distorted truly arbitrarily, there are lots of things you could try, but the simplest would probably be to compute a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean" rel="nofollow">weighted average</a> from your existing point mappings.  Your weights could be the squared inverse of the x/y distance from your new point to each of your existing points.</p>

<p>Some pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>estimate-latitude-longitude (x, y)

    numerator-latitude := 0
    numerator-longitude := 0
    denominator := 0

    for each point,
        deltaX := x - point.x
        deltaY := y - point.y
        distSq := deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY
        weight := 1 / distSq

        numerator-latitude += weight * point.latitude
        numerator-longitude += weight * point.longitude
        denominator += weight

    return (numerator-latitude / denominator, numerator-longitude / denominator)
</code></pre>

<p>This code will give a relatively simple approximation.  If you can be more precise about the way the projection distorts the geographical coordinates, you can probably do much better.</p>
<p>Here is some sample code. I think this is what you are looking for. The following displays exactly the same in Firefox 3 (mac) and IE7.</p>

<p>recognizing text inside an image is indeed a hot topic for researchers in that field, but only begun to grow out of control when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha" rel="nofollow">captcha's</a> became the "norm" in terms of defense against spam bots. Why use captcha's as protection? well because it is/was very hard to locate (and read) text inside an image!</p>

<p>The reason why I mention captcha's is because the most advancement* is made within that tiny area, and I think that your solution could be best found there.
especially because captcha's are indeed about locating text (or something that resembles text) inside a cluttered image and afterwards trying to read the letters correctly.</p>

<p>so if you can find yourself <a href="http://libcaca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha" rel="nofollow">a good open source captcha breaking tool</a> you probably have all you need to continue your quest... <br>
You could probably even throw away the most dificult code that handles the character recognition itself, because those OCR's are used to read distorted text, something you don't have to do.</p>

<p>*: advancement in terms of visible, usable, and <strong>practical</strong> information for a "non-researcher"</p>
<p>When I wrote my first trigger it was in Perl because that was the language used in the example I found but the last triggers I wrote where in Python because I'm more comfortable with that.</p>

<p>I think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but I think Perl is still better supported.</p>
<p>I can't think of any cross platform way of what you want (or any guaranteed way full stop) but as you are using GetTickCount perhaps you aren't interested in cross platform :)</p>

<p>I'd use interprocess communications and set the intensive processes nice levels to get what you require but I'm not sure that's appropriate for your situation.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I agree with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1982/#1984" rel="nofollow">Bernard</a> which is why I think a process rather than a thread might be more appropriate but it just might not suit your purposes.</p>
<p>The list [1,2,3] is dynamic and flexible but that flexibility comes at a speed cost.</p>

<p>The tuple (1,2,3) is fixed (immutable) and therefore faster.</p>

<p>If you want lisp to look like Ruby use Ruby. </p>

<p>It's possible to use Ruby (and Python) in a very lisp like way which is one of the main reasons they have gained acceptance so quickly.</p>
<p>@sparkes</p>

<p>Sometimes LISP is the clear language choice, namely Emacs extensions.  I'm sure I could use Ruby to extend Emacs if I wanted to, but Emacs was designed to be extended with LISP, so it seems to make sense to use it in that situation.</p>
<p>If the data modification is not too time consuming (meaning, if the main purpose of the background thread is not the actual data modification), try moving the section that modifies the data to a delegate and Invoke'ing that delegate.</p>

<p>If the actual heavy work is on the data, you'll probably have to create a deep copy of this data to pass to the background thread, which will send the processed data back to the UI thread via Invoke again.</p>
<p>You should be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (control.InvokeRequired)<br>{<br>    control.Invoke(delegateWithMyCode);<br>}<br>else<br>{<br>    delegateWithMyCode();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>InvokeRequired is a property on Controls to see if you are on the correct thread, then Invoke will invoke the delegate on the correct thread.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Actually, at my last job we did something like this:</p>

<pre><code>private void SomeEventHandler(Object someParam)<br>{<br>    if (this.InvokeRequired)<br>    {<br>        this.Invoke(new SomeEventHandlerDelegate(SomeEventHandler), someParam);<br>    }<br><br>    // Regular handling code<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>which removes the need for the else block and kind of tightens up the code.</p>
<p>Would use double.TryParse, it has performance benefits.</p>

<p>As I don't have a test case to go from I can't guarantee this solution, but it seems to me that a scenario similar to the one used to update progress bars in different threads (use a delegate) would be suitable here.</p>

<pre><code>public delegate void DataBindDelegate();<br>public DataBindDelegate BindData = new DataBindDelegate(DoDataBind);<br><br>public void DoDataBind()<br>{<br>    DataBind();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>If the data binding needs to be done by a particular thread, then let that thread do the work!</p>
<p>I'd personally use int.tryparse, then double.tryparse.  Performance on those methods is quite fast.  They both return a Boolean.  If both fail then you have a string, per how you defined your data. </p>
<p>On linux, you can change the scheduling priority of a thread with nice().</p>
<p>I would say, don't worry so much about such micro performance.  It is much better to just get something to work, and then make it as clear and concise and easy to read as possible.  The worst thing you can do is sacrifice readability for an insignificant amount of performance.</p>

<p>In the end, the best way to deal with performance issues is to save them for when you have data that indicates there is an actual performance problem... otherwise you will spend a lot of time micro-optimizing and actually cause higher maintenance costs for later on.</p>

<p>If you find this parsing situation is really the bottleneck in your application, THEN is the time to try and figure out what the fastest way to solve the problem is.  I think Jeff (and many others) have blogged about this sort of thing a lot.</p>
<p>Re: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1994/#2004">2004</a></p>

<p>No, you will only <strong>move</strong> the code that changes the data into the delegate function (because the data change is what triggers the control update). Other than that, you should not have to write anything extra.</p>

<p>If the thread call is "illegal" (i.e. the DataBind call affects controls that were not created in the thread it is being called from) then you need to create a delegate so that even if the decision / preparation for the DataBind is not done in the control-creating thread, any resultant modification of them (i.e. DataBind()) will be.</p>

<p>You would call my code from the worker thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>this.BindData.Invoke();<br></code></pre>

<p>This would then cause the original thread to do the binding, which (presuming it is the thread that created the controls) should work.</p>
<p>This is more or less the perfect use case for <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/view/HomePage" rel="nofollow">SVK</a>.  SVK is a command line front end for subversion that works with an entire local copy of the repository.  So your commits, updates, etc. work on the local repository and you can then sync with a master.  I would generally recommend SVK over plain subversion anyway as it makes a lot of things nicer.  No .svn folders, better branching and merging, better conflict resolution.</p>

<p>One way of deciding whether or not to use nested classes is to think whether or not this class plays a supporting role or it's own part.</p>

<p>If it exists solely for the purpose of helping another class then I generally make it a nested class. There are a whole load of caveats to that, some of which seem contradictory but it all comes down to experience and gut-feeling.</p>
<p>sounds like a case where you could use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern" rel="nofollow">strategy pattern</a></p>
<p>Also make sure you don't miss the <a href="http://www.dnrtv.com/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">dnrTV webcast show</a> that Carl Franklin (the man behind .NET rocks) publishes. Even if it's a not a podcast and requires a more attention while watching it it's really informative and if you're into .NET and Microsoft related techniques you'll learn a lot.</p>
<p>Here is my own contribution for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_">Java programming language</a>.</p>

<p>first some code:</p>

<pre><code>public void swap(int x, int y)<br>{<br>  int tmp = x;<br>  x = y;<br>  y = tmp;<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>calling this method will result in this:</p>

<pre><code>int pi = 3;<br>int everything = 42;<br><br>swap(pi, everything);<br><br>System.out.println("pi: " + pi);<br>System.out.println("everything: " + everything);<br><br>"Output:<br>pi: 3<br>everything: 42"<br></code></pre>

<p>even using 'real' objects will show a similar result:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyObj {<br>    private String msg;<br>    private int number;<br><br>    //getters and setters<br>    public String getMsg() {<br>        return this.msg;<br>    }<br><br><br>    public void setMsg(String msg) {<br>        this.msg = msg;<br>    }<br><br><br>    public int getNumber() {<br>        return this.number;<br>    }<br><br><br>    public void setNumber(int number) {<br>        this.number = number;<br>    }<br><br>    //constructor<br>    public MyObj(String msg, int number) {<br>        setMsg(msg);<br>        setNumber(number);<br>    }<br>}<br><br>public static void swap(MyObj x, MyObj y)<br>{<br>    MyObj tmp = x;<br>    x = y;<br>    y = tmp;<br>}<br><br>public static void main(String args[]) {<br>    MyObj x = new MyObj("Hello world", 1);<br>    MyObj y = new MyObj("Goodbye Cruel World", -1); <br><br>    swap(x, y);<br><br>    System.out.println(x.getMsg() + " -- "+  x.getNumber());<br>    System.out.println(y.getMsg() + " -- "+  y.getNumber());<br>}<br><br><br>"Output:<br>Hello world -- 1<br>Goodbye Cruel World -- -1"<br></code></pre>

<p>thus it is clear that Java passes its parameters <strong>by value</strong>, as the value for <em>pi</em> and <em>everything</em> and the <em>MyObj objects</em> aren't swapped.
be aware that "by value" is the <em>only way</em> in java to pass parameters to a method. (for example a language like c++ allows the developer to pass a parameter by reference using '<strong>&amp;</strong>' after the parameter's type)</p>

<p>now the <strong>tricky part</strong>, or at least the part that will confuse most of the new java developers: (borrowed from <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2000-05/03-qa-0526-pass.html">javaworld</a>) <br>
Original author: Tony Sintes</p>

<pre><code>public void tricky(Point arg1, Point arg2)<br>{<br>    arg1.x = 100;<br>    arg1.y = 100;<br>    Point temp = arg1;<br>    arg1 = arg2;<br>    arg2 = temp;<br>}<br>public static void main(String [] args)<br>{<br>    Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0);<br>    Point pnt2 = new Point(0,0);<br>    System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y: " +pnt1.y); <br>    System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y);<br>    System.out.println(" ");<br>    tricky(pnt1,pnt2);<br>    System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y:" + pnt1.y); <br>    System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y);  <br>}<br><br><br>"Output<br>X: 0 Y: 0<br>X: 0 Y: 0<br>X: 100 Y: 100<br>X: 0 Y: 0"<br></code></pre>

<p><em>tricky</em> successfully changes the value of pnt1!
This would imply that Objects are passed by reference, this is not the case!
A correct statement would be: <strong>the <em>Object references</em> are passed by value.</strong>  </p>

<p>more from Tony Sintes:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method successfully alters the
  value of pnt1, even though it is
  passed by value; however, a swap of
  pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major
  source of confusion. In the main()
  method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more
  than object references. When you pass
  pnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method,
  Java passes the references by value
  just like any other parameter. This
  means the references passed to the
  method are actually copies of the
  original references. Figure 1 below
  shows two references pointing to the
  same object after Java passes an
  object to a method.</p>

<li>Java passes it parameters <strong>by value</strong></li>
<li><em>"by value"</em> is the <strong>only way</strong> in java to pass a parameter to a method</li>

  <p><strong>?</strong>: This file is not under version control</p>
  
  <p><strong>!</strong>: This file is under version control but is missing or incomplete</p>
  
  <p><strong>A</strong>: This file will be added to version control (after commit)</p>
  
  <p><strong>A+</strong>: This file will be moved (after commit)</p>
  
  <p><strong>D</strong>: This file will be deleted (after commit)</p>
  
  <p><strong>S</strong>: This signifies that the file or directory has been switched from the path of the rest of the working copy (using svn switch) to a
  branch</p>
  
  <p><strong>I</strong>: Ignored</p>
  
  <p><strong>X</strong>: External definition</p>
  
  <p><strong>~</strong>: Type changed</p>
  
  <p><strong>R</strong>: Item has been replaced in your working copy. This means the file was scheduled for deletion, and then a new file with the same name was scheduled for addition in its place.</p>
  
  <p><strong>L</strong>    : Item is locked</p>
  
  <p><strong>E</strong>: Item existed, as it would have been created, by an svn update.</p>

<p>Subversion makes it easy (some think too easy) to create a new branch using the svn copy command.</p>

<pre><code>$ svn copy svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk \

<p>I think you're looking for GetModuleFileName.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swissdelphicenter.ch/torry/showcode.php?id=143">http://www.swissdelphicenter.ch/torry/showcode.php?id=143</a>:</p>

The general idea is that you'd extract the cross-functional concern (i.e. Retry for x hours) into a separate class and then you'd annotate any methods that need to modify their behaviour in that way. Here's how it might look (with a nice extension method on Int32)</P><PRE><CODE>[RetryFor( 10.Hours() )]
public void DeleteArchive()
{
  //.. code to just delete the archive
}
</CODE></PRE>
<p>You do the unit testing by mocking out the database connection. This way, you can build scenarios where specific queries in the flow of a method call succeed or fail. I usually build my mock expectations so that the actual query text is ignored, because I really want to test the fault tolerance of the method and how it handles itself -- the specifics of the SQL are irrelevant to that end. </p>

<p>Obviously this means your test won't actually verify that the method <em>works</em>, because the SQL may be wrong. This is where integration tests kick in. For that, I expect someone else will have a more thorough answer, as I'm just beginning to get to grips with those myself.</p>
<p>In my experience with LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities a DataContext is synonymous to a connection to the database. So if you were to use multiple data stores you would need to use multiple DataContexts. My gut reaction is you wouldn't notice to much of a slow down with a DataContext that encompasses a large number of tables. If you did however you could always split the database logically at points where you can isolate tables that don't have any relationship to other sets of tables and create multiple contexts.</p>
<p>Don't forget there is also <strong>pass by name</strong>, and <strong>pass by value-result</strong>.</p>

<p>Pass by value-result is similar to pass by value, with the added aspect that the value is set in the original variable that was passed as the parameter.  It can, to some extent, avoid interference with global variables.  It is apparently better in partitioned memory, where a pass by reference could cause a page fault (<a href="http://logos.cs.uic.edu/476/notes/PassByRefOrValResult.html">Reference</a>).</p>

<p>Pass by name means that the values are only calculated when they are actually used, rather than at the start of the procedure.  Algol used pass-by-name, but an interesting side effect is that is it very difficult to write a swap procedure (<a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/Teaching/383/PassByName.html">Reference</a>).  Also, the expression passed by name is re-evaluated each time it is accessed, which can also have side effects.</p>
<p>RSS isn't "push", which means that you need to have something that polls the website.  It's much less traffic than getting the whole site or front page (for instance, you can say "Give me all articles newer than the last time I asked"), but it's traffic nonetheless.</p>

<p>It's generally understood you shouldn't have a refresh of more than 30 minutes in an automated client. (Citation required).</p>

<p>Having said that, you may find a client which allows you to set a more frequent refresh.</p>
<p>I've used <a href="http://www.pingie.com" rel="nofollow">Pingie</a> in the past to send me an SMS when a new items appears in an RSS feed. Perhaps that would be useful for you if you have a cell phone text messaging plan.</p>
<p>I enabled compression following similar articles to those posted above. The key to accessing the ViewState before the application sends it was overriding this method;</p>

<pre><code>protected override void SavePageStateToPersistenceMedium(object viewState)<br></code></pre>

<p>You can call the base method within this override and then add whatever additional logic you require to handle the ViewState.</p>
<p><a href="http://exo.org.uk/code/rss2mail/" rel="nofollow">RSS2mail</a> is a simple python script which I used extensively a few years back.</p>

<p>As Matthew stated you really shouldn't bother an RSS feed more than the producer allows but you can use http headers to check for changes in a very light way which is something rss2email does quite well.</p>
<p>I would also mock the database, and check that the queries are what you expected. There is the risk that the test checks the wrong sql, but this would be detected in the integration tests</p>
<p>Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View).  In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well.  A good example of this is the <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/mvc-storefront/">MVC Storefront project</a>.</p>

<p>There is a discussion <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2007/10/31/development-trivial-pursuit-the-difference-between-mvc-and-the-different-flavors-of-mvp.aspx">here</a> regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP.</p>

<p>The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other.</p>

<p>MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view.</p>

<p>Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just  displays the variables provided by the Controller).</p>

<p>To perhaps get an idea of the ASP.NET MVC distinction from MVP, check out <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVCSessionAtMix08TDDAndMvcMockHelpers.aspx">this MIX presentation</a> by Scott Hanselman.</p>
<p>I blogged about this a while back, quoting on <a href="http://blogs.infragistics.com/blogs/todd_snyder/archive/2007/10/17/mvc-or-mvp-pattern-whats-the-difference.aspx">Todd Snyder's excellent post on the difference between the two</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are the key differences between
  the patterns:</p>
  
  <p><strong>MVP Pattern</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>View is more loosely coupled to the model. The presenter is
  responsible for binding the model to
  the view.</li>
  <li>Easier to unit test because interaction with the view is through
  an interface</li>
  <li>Usually view to presenter map one to one. Complex views may have
  multi presenters.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>MVC Pattern</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Controller are based on behaviors and can be shared across
  views</li>
  <li>Can be responsible for determining which view to display</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the best explanation on the web I could find.</p>

<ul>
<li>MVP = Model-View-Presenter</li>
<li><p>MVC = Model-View-Controller</p>

<ol>
<li>Both presentation patterns.  They separate the dependencies between a Model (think Domain objects), your screen/web page (the View), and how your UI is supposed to behave (Presenter/Controller)</li>
<li>They are fairly similar in concept, folks initialize the Presenter/Controller differently depending on taste.</li>
<li>A great article on the differences is <a href="http://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/todd_snyder/archive/2007/10/17/mvc-or-mvp-pattern-whats-the-difference.aspx">here</a>.  Most notable is that MVC pattern has the Model updating the View.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>You could always knock something up yourself...  I've done it in the past and it really isn't too difficult a job to write an RSS parser.</p>

<p>Of course, as others have mentioned, there's an etiquette question as to how much of the website's valuable bandwidth you want to hog for yourself in RSS request traffic.  That's a matter for your own conscience. ;)</p>
<p>The problem I experienced when unit testing persistence, especially without an ORM and thus mocking your database (connection), is that you don't really know if your queries succeed. It could be that you your queries are specifically designed for a particular database version and only succeed with that version. You'll never find that out if you mock your database. So in my opinion, unit testing persistence is only of limited use. You should always add tests running against the targeted database.</p>
<p>If you have access to Microsoft Outlook 2007 or Thunderbird, these email clients allow you to add RSS feeds in the same way you would add an email account.</p>

<p>I use Google Reader generally but when I want to keep up-to-date with something specific, I add the RSS feed to Outlook and it arrives in my inbox as if it was an email.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>Round(1.5) = 2
Round(2.5) = 2
Round(1.5, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) = 2
Round(2.5, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) = 3
Round(1.55, 1) = 1.6
Round(1.65, 1) = 1.6
Round(1.55, 1, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) = 1.6
Round(1.65, 1, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) = 1.7

Truncate(2.10) = 2
Truncate(2.00) = 2
Truncate(1.90) = 1
Truncate(1.80) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>For NHibernate, I'd definitely advocate just mocking out the NHibernate API for unit tests -- trust the library to do the right thing. If you want to ensure that the data actually goes to the DB, do an integration test.</p>
<p>Technically unit tests of persistance are not Unit tests they are Integration tests.</p>

<p>With C# using mbUnit, you simply use the SqlRestoreInfo and RollBack attributes</p>

<pre><code>    [TestFixture]<br>    [SqlRestoreInfo(&lt;connectionsting&gt;, &lt;name&gt;,&lt;backupLocation&gt;]<br>    public class Tests<br>    {<br><br>        [SetUp]<br>        public void Setup()<br>        {<br><br>        }<br><br>        [Test]<br>        [RollBack]<br>        public void TEST()<br>        {<br>           //test insert. <br>        }<br>    }<br></code></pre>

<p>The same can be done in NUnit, excpet the attribute names differ slighty.</p>

<p>As for checking if your query was succeful, you normally need to follow it with a second query to see if the database has been changed as you expect.</p>
<p>I've been using Copy Handler. The nicest thing about it is that it queues up its jobs like a download manager. It has a shell extension so you can either rightclick drag, or just set copy with copyhandler as the default action.</p>
<p>I built myself a PC with 4GB RAM, dual core 1.8GHz 40GB PATA drive primary, and 250GB SATA drive secondary, and installed Windows Vista Business Edition. When I had to copy 120GB of data from my old PATA disk, Vista failed miserably and kept crashing. I definitely recommend Teracopy Free Edition.</p>

<p>I would definitely prefer:  </p>

<p>1) <a href="http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.asp">Teracopy</a> - GUI based, replaces the default Windows copy/move UI and adds itself to context menu. Basic version is free (for home use I guess).  </p>

<p>2) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a> - CLI based, useful when scripting. Free tool from MS and is included in Vista/Windows 2008. MS Technet has a GUI for robocopy as well - useful to create statements that you can later embed in scripts or on the command prompt.</p>

<p>PS: I know these have been already suggested here and I would have voted on them, if I could.</p>
<p>If you correctly markup your HTML code, there is no need for javascript. The following code will allow the user to click on the label text to tick the checkbox.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="surname"&gt;Surname&lt;/label&gt;<br>&lt;input type="checkbox" name="surname" id="surname" /&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>The <em>for</em> attribute on the label element links to the <em>id</em> attribute on the input element and the browser does the rest.</p>

<p>This has been testing to work in:</p>

<ul>
<li>IE6</li>
<li>IE7</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
</ul>
<p>The .Net 2.0 framework namespace <code>System.IO.Compression</code> supports GZip and Deflate algorithms. Here are two methods that compress and decompress a byte stream which you can get from your file object. You can subsitute <code>GZipStream</code> for <code>DefaultStream</code> in the methods below to use that algorithm. This still leaves the problem of handling files compressed with different algorithms though.</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] Compress(byte[] data)
{
    MemoryStream output = new MemoryStream();

    GZipStream gzip = new GZipStream(output, CompressionMode.Compress, true);
    gzip.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    gzip.Close();

    return output.ToArray();
}

public static byte[] Decompress(byte[] data)
{
    MemoryStream input = new MemoryStream();
    input.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
    input.Position = 0;

    GZipStream gzip = new GZipStream(input, CompressionMode.Decompress, true);

    MemoryStream output = new MemoryStream();

    byte[] buff = new byte[64];
    int read = -1;

    read = gzip.Read(buff, 0, buff.Length);

    while (read &gt; 0)
    {
        output.Write(buff, 0, read);
        read = gzip.Read(buff, 0, buff.Length);
    }

    gzip.Close();

    return output.ToArray();
}
</code></pre>

<p>No, because while you thought LINQ is really just syntactic sugar, it actually heavily used expression trees -- a feature absent in .NET 2.0.</p>

<p>That being said .NET 3.5 only builds up on top of .NET 2.0, and that's the reason why the IL doesn't look "different" or "special".</p>

<p>I do not see a reason why you shouldn't just install the .NET 3.5 Framework. Everything .NET 2.0 will work fine on it, promise :)</p>
<p>There are some "Hacks" that involve using a System.Core.dll from the 3.5 Framework to make it run with .net 2.0, but personally I would not want use such a somewhat shaky foundation.</p>

<p>See here: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2007/09/05/linq-support-on-net-2-0.aspx">LINQ support on .NET 2.0</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Create a new console application</li>
  <li>Keep only System and System.Core as referenced assemblies</li>
  <li>Set Copy Local to true for System.Core, because it does not exist in .NET 2.0</li>
  <li>Use a LINQ query in the Main method. For example the one below.</li>
  <li>Build</li>
  <li>Copy all the bin output to a machine where only .NET 2.0 is installed</li>
  <li>Run</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>(Requires .net 2.0 SP1 and I have no idea if bundling the System.Core.dll violates the EULA)</p>

<p>In theory yes, provided you distribute the LINQ specific assemblies and any dependencies. However that is in violation of Microsoft's licensing. Scott Hanselman wrote a blog post about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DeployingASPNETMVCOnASPNET20.aspx">Deploying ASP.NET MVC on ASP.NET 2.0</a> which is similar to what you are wanting to do.</p>
<p>As far as I know the LINQ library is only available since the framework 3.0.
If you want to use something similar in the framework 2.0, you would need to rewritte it yourself :) or find a similar third-party library. I only found a bit of information <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2007/09/05/linq-support-on-net-2-0.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> but it didn't convinced me either.</p>
<p>You can wrap your checkbox in the label:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label style="display: block; padding: 50px 0 0 50px; background-color: pink; width: 80px; height: 80px"><br>  &lt;input type="checkbox" name="surname"><br>&lt;/label><br></code></pre>
<p>You can accomplish this with Section Handlers. There is a basic overview of how to write one at <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/ConfigSections.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/ConfigSections.aspx</a> however it refers to app.config which would be pretty much the same as writing one for use in web.config. This will allow you to essentially have your own XML tree in the config file and do some more advanced configuration.</p>
<p>Assuming you have the correct assemblies and a C# compiler you in theory can use whatever you want to edit the code and then just run the compiler by hand or using a build script. That being said it is a real pain doing .NET development without Visual Studio/SharpEdit/Monodevelop in my opinion.</p>
<p>Ronnie,</p>

<p>If you wanted to enclose the label text and checkbox inside a wrapper element, you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="surname"&gt;<br>    Surname<br>    &lt;input type="checkbox" name="surname" id="surname" /&gt;<br>&lt;/label&gt;<br></code></pre>
<p>I haven't done SWING development since my early CS classes but if it wasn't built in you could just inherit javax.swing.AbstractButton and create your own. Should be pretty simple to wire something together with their existing framework.</p>
<p>The JITter will sometimes use non-virtual calls to methods in sealed classes since there is no way they can be extended further.</p>

<p>There are complex rules regarding calling type, virtual/nonvirtual, and I don't know them all so I can't really outline them for you, but if you google for sealed classes and virtual methods you might find some articles on the topic.</p>

<p>Note that any kind of performance benefit you would obtain from this level of optimization should be regarded as last-resort, always optimize on the algorithmic level before you optimize on the code-level.</p>

<p>Here's one link mentioning this: <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/01/05/rambling-on-the-sealed-keyword.aspx">Rambling on the sealed keyword</a></p>
<P>Wrapping with the label still doesn't allow clicking 'anywhere in the box' - still just on the text! This does the job for me:</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;div onclick="dob.checked=!dob.checked" class="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input onclick="checked=!checked" id="dob" type="checkbox"/&gt;Date of birth entry must be completed&lt;/div&gt;
</CODE></PRE>
<P>but unfortunately has lots of javascript that is effectively toggling twice.</P>
<p>Sealed classes <em>should</em> provide a performance improvement. Since a sealed class cannot be derived, any virtual members can be turned into non-virtual members.</p>

<p>Of course, we're talking really small gains. I wouldn't mark a class as sealed just to get a performance improvement unless profiling revealed it to be a problem.</p>
<p>@Vaibhav, what kind of tests did you execute to measure performance?</p>

<p>I guess one would have to use <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/sscli/" rel="nofollow">Rotor</a> and to drill into CLI and understand how a sealed class would improve performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SSCLI (Rotor)</strong> <br>
  SSCLI: Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure</p>
  
  <p>The Common Language Infrastructure
  (CLI) is the ECMA standard that

<p>Normally you'd copy it to svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project/branches/mybranch so that you can keep several branches in the repository, but your syntax is valid.</p>

<p>Here's some advice on <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s07.html">how to set up your repository layout</a>.</p>
<p>If you even plan on merging your branch, I highly suggest you look at this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py" rel="nofollow">Svnmerge.py</a></p>

<p>I hear Subversion 1.5 builds more of the merge tracking in, I have no experience with that. My project is on 1.4.x and svnmerge.py is a life saver!</p>

<p>You could always try the Synth look &amp; feel. You provide an xml file that acts as a sort of stylesheet, along with any images you want to use. The code might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    SynthLookAndFeel synth = new SynthLookAndFeel();
    Class aClass = MainFrame.class;
    InputStream stream = aClass.getResourceAsStream("\\default.xml");

    if (stream == null) {
        System.err.println("Missing configuration file");
        System.exit(-1);                
    }

    synth.load(stream, aClass);

    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(synth);
} catch (ParseException pe) {
    System.err.println("Bad configuration file");
    pe.printStackTrace();
    System.exit(-2);
} catch (UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ulfe) {
    System.err.println("Old JRE in use. Get a new one");
    System.exit(-3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>From there, go on and add your JButton like you normally would. The only change is that you use the setName(string) method to identify what the button should map to in the xml file.</p>

<p>The xml file might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;synth&gt;
    &lt;style id="button"&gt;
        &lt;font name="DIALOG" size="12" style="BOLD"/&gt;
        &lt;state value="MOUSE_OVER"&gt;
            &lt;imagePainter method="buttonBackground" path="dirt.png" sourceInsets="2 2 2 2"/&gt;
            &lt;insets top="2" botton="2" right="2" left="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/state&gt;
        &lt;state value="ENABLED"&gt;
            &lt;imagePainter method="buttonBackground" path="dirt.png" sourceInsets="2 2 2 2"/&gt;
            &lt;insets top="2" botton="2" right="2" left="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/state&gt;
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;bind style="button" type="name" key="dirt"/&gt;
&lt;/synth&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The bind element there specifies what to map to (in this example, it will apply that styling to any buttons whose name property has been set to "dirt").</p>

<p>And a couple of useful links:</p>

<p><a href="http://javadesktop.org/articles/synth/" rel="nofollow">http://javadesktop.org/articles/synth/</a></p>

<p>I believe you are talking about a content management system. The way I have delt with this situation in the past is to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allow a page/content to define an extra custom stylesheet or</li>
<li>Allow a page/content to define inline style tags</li>
</ol>
<p>This will allow you to pass a weight of 0 and still work properly.  Notice the === operator, this checks to see if weight matches "null" in both value and type (as opposed to ==, which is just value, so 0 == null == false).</p>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>public function createShipment($startZip, $endZip, $weight=null){<br>    if ($weight === null)<br>        $weight = $this-&gt;getDefaultWeight();<br>}<br></code></pre>
<P>Thxm, Mc! http://asm.objectweb.org/ is another one. <EM>Excellent</EM> documentation on byte code instrumentation, but nothing "directly" aimed at writing a coverage tool - just some hints or ideas.</P>
<p>Quick'n Dirty:</p>

<p>First create your <strong>ConfigurationSection</strong> and <strong>ConfigurationElement</strong> classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyStuffSection : ConfigurationSection
{
    ConfigurationProperty _MyStuffElement;

    public MyStuffSection()
    {
        _MyStuffElement = new ConfigurationProperty("MyStuff", typeof(MyStuffElement), null);

        this.Properties.Add(_MyStuffElement);
    }

    public MyStuffElement MyStuff
    {
        get
        {
            return this[_MyStuffElement] as MyStuffElement;
        }
    }
}

public class MyStuffElement : ConfigurationElement
{
    ConfigurationProperty _SomeStuff;

    public MyStuffElement()
    {
        _SomeStuff = new ConfigurationProperty("SomeStuff", typeof(string), "&lt;UNDEFINED&gt;");

        this.Properties.Add(_SomeStuff);
    }

    public string SomeStuff
    {
        get
        {
            return (String)this[_SomeStuff];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then let the framework know how to handle your configuration classes in <strong>web.config</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;configSections&gt;
    &lt;section name="MyStuffSection" type="MyWeb.Configuration.MyStuffSection" /&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>And actually add your own section below:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;MyStuffSection&gt;
    &lt;MyStuff SomeStuff="Hey There!" /&gt;
  &lt;/MyStuffSection&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use it in your code thus:</p>

<pre><code>MyWeb.Configuration.MyStuffSection configSection = ConfigurationManager.GetSection("MyStuffSection") as MyWeb.Configuration.MyStuffSection;

if (configSection != null &amp;&amp; configSection.MyStuff != null)
{
    Response.Write(configSection.MyStuff.SomeStuff);
}
</code></pre>
<p>NUnit is always a favorite of mine.  However if you are using TFS as your source control I suggest you stick with the Microsoft Stack.  </p>
<p>Set the CSS "display" property for the label to be a block element and use that instead of your div - it keeps the semantic meaning of a label while allowing whatever styling you like.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="test" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: block; background-color: #e0e0ff;"&gt;
    A ticky box! &lt;input type="checkbox" id="test" /&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this is possible. One of the main pros for using Swing is the ease with which the abstract controls can be created and manipulates.</p>

<p>Here is a quick and dirty way to extend the existing JButton class to draw a circle to the right of the text.</p>

<pre><code>package test;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Container;
import java.awt.Dimension;
import java.awt.FlowLayout;
import java.awt.Graphics;

import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class MyButton extends JButton {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private Color circleColor = Color.BLACK;

    public MyButton(String label) {
        super(label);
    }

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);

        Dimension originalSize = super.getPreferredSize();
        int gap = (int) (originalSize.height * 0.2);
        int x = originalSize.width + gap;
        int y = gap;
        int diameter = originalSize.height - (gap * 2);

        g.setColor(circleColor);
        g.fillOval(x, y, diameter, diameter);
    }

    @Override
    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {
        Dimension size = super.getPreferredSize();
        size.width += size.height;
        return size;
    }

    /*Test the button*/
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyButton button = new MyButton("Hello, World!");

        JFrame frame = new JFrame();
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(400, 400);

        Container contentPane = frame.getContentPane();
        contentPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        contentPane.add(button);

        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that by overriding <strong>paintComponent</strong> that the contents of the button can be changed, but that the border is painted by the <strong>paintBorder</strong> method. The <strong>getPreferredSize</strong> method also needs to be managed in order to dynamically support changes to the content. Care needs to be taken when measuring font metrics and image dimensions.</p>

<p>For creating a control that you can rely on, the above code is not the correct approach. Dimensions and colours are dynamic in Swing and are dependent on the look and feel being used. Even the default <em>Metal</em> look has changed across JRE versions. It would be better to implement <strong>AbstractButton</strong> and conform to the guidelines set out by the Swing API. A good starting point is to look at the <strong>javax.swing.LookAndFeel</strong> and <strong>javax.swing.UIManager</strong> classes.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/UIManager.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/UIManager.html</a></p>

<p>Understanding the anatomy of LookAndFeel is useful for writing controls:

<p>For a Mock Object library, I've found the BSD-licensed <a href="http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" rel="nofollow">Rhino.Mocks</a> to be rather pleasing.</p>
<p>What I would do for the particular case is:</p>

<p>i. Define the body as a server side control</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body runat="server" id="masterpageBody"&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>ii. In your content aspx page, register the MasterPage with the register:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% MasterPageFile="..." %&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>iii. In the Content Page, you can now simply use </p>

<pre><code>Master.FindControl("masterpageBody")<br></code></pre>

<p>and have access to the control. Now, you can change whatever properties/style that you like!</p>
<p>When I was first learning Java we had to make Yahtzee and I thought it would be cool to create custom Swing components and containers instead of just drawing everything on one JPanel.  The benefit of extending Swing components, of course, is to have the ability to add support for keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features that you can't do just by having a paint() method print a pretty picture.  It may not be done the best way however, but it may be a good starting point for you.</p>

<p>Edit 8/6 - If it wasn't apparent from the images, each Die is a button you can click. This will move it to the DiceContainer below.  Looking at the source code you can see that each Die button is drawn dynamically, based on its value.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/pgyQp.jpg" alt="alt text"><br>
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/jkYRd.jpg" alt="alt text"><br>
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/9BI34.jpg" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a class that extends JComponent</li>
<li>Call parent constructor super() in your constructors</li>
<li>Make sure you class implements MouseListener</li>
<li><p>Put this in the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>enableInputMethods(true);   
addMouseListener(this);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override these methods:</p>

<pre><code>public Dimension getPreferredSize()  
public Dimension getMinimumSize()  
public Dimension getMaximumSize()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override this method:</p>

<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getPreferredSize(), assuming getMinimumSize() and getMaximumSize() return the same value.  I haven't experimented too much with this but, depending on the layout you use for your GUI your button could look completely different.</p>

<p>And finally, the <a href="https://github.com/kdeloach/labs/blob/master/java/yahtzee/src/Dice.java">source code</a>.  In case I missed anything.  </p>

<p><strong>NUnit</strong> is available at <a href="http://www.nunit.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.nunit.org</a>
I would suggest this even when working on the MS stack - the support for non-MS frameworks is happening in the MVC previews which shows a definite movement in the right direction to allow us all to customise our stacks to fit.</p>

<p>in 1.x there used to be things DataTables couldn't do which DataSets could (don't remember exactly what). All that was changed in 2.x.  My guess is that's why a lot of examples still use DataSets.  DataTables should be quicker as they are more lightweight. If you're only pulling a single resultset, its your best choice between the two.</p>
<p>It really depends on the sort of data you're bringing back.  Since a DataSet is (in effect) just a collection of DataTable objects, you can return multiple distinct sets of data into a single, and therefore more manageable, object.  </p>

<p>Performance-wise, you're more likely to get inefficiency from unoptimized queries than from the "wrong" choice of .NET construct.  At least, that's been my experience.</p>

<p>One feature of the DataSet is that if you can call multiple select statements in your stored procedures, the DataSet will have one DataTable for each.</p>
<p>Try the Managed Fusion Url Rewriter and Reverse Proxy:</p>

<p><a href="http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com">http://urlrewriter.codeplex.com</a></p>

<p>The rule for rewriting this would be:</p>

<pre><code># clean up old rules and forward to new URL
RewriteRule ^/?user=(.*)  /users/$1 [NC,R=301]

# rewrite the rule internally
RewriteRule ^/users/(.*)  /?user=$1 [NC,L]

<p>From the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-are-there-separate-tuple-and-list-data-types">Python FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in fundamentally different ways. Tuples can be thought of as being similar to Pascal records or C structs; they're small collections of related data which may be of different types which are operated on as a group. For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.</p>
  
  <p>Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally by convention you wouldn't choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.  You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.</p>
<p>I'm definitely not a Ruby expert, but I'll give it a shot:</p>

<pre><code>$ irb 
system "echo Hi"
Hi
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>You should also be able to do things like:</p>

<pre><code>cmd = 'ls'
system(cmd)
</code></pre>

<p>I am thinking off the top of my head here. If you load both as Data Tables in the same Data Sets, and define a relation between the two over SKU, and then run a query on the Data Set which produces the desired result.</p>
<p>It depends on the project, how and where it is hosted. The best thing is to find a contact and email them or see if there is a developers mailing list.</p>
<p>This is what I came up with:</p>

<p>In the page load function:</p>

<pre><code>HtmlGenericControl body = (HtmlGenericControl)Master.FindControl("default_body");
body.Style.Add(HtmlTextWriterStyle.BackgroundColor, "#2E6095");
</code></pre>

<p>Where </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>default_body = the id of the body tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thing you should do is contact the main people who run the open source project. Ask them if it is ok to contribute to the code and go from there.</p>

<p>Simply writing your improved code and then giving it to them may result in your code being rejected.</p>
<p>Scott Guthrie covers how to do this natively in .Net pretty extensively <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/02/26/tip-trick-url-rewriting-with-asp-net.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>I've used the httpmodule approach and it works well.  It's basically what ManagedFusion is doing for you.</p>
<P>if its .net on both sides:</P>
<P>think you should use binary serialization and send the byte[] result.</P>
<P>trusting your struct to be fully blittable can be trouble.</P>
<P>you will pay in some overhead (both cpu and network) but will be safe.</P>
<p>I would spend time getting to know the people first.  Usually they have a IRC chatroom where everyone idles.  Spend sometime getting to know the people, study the code, review the documentation, then if you feel like you are a correct fit for the project, start contributing to bug patches.  Don't try to add new features at first.  They won't generally be accepted.</p>

<p>Also watch this google tech talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F-3E8pyjFo" rel="nofollow">How To Protect Your Open Source Project from Poisonous People</a>.  It will teach you what not to do.</p>

<p>Branching in Subversion is facilitated by a very very light and efficient copying facility.</p>

<p>Branching and tagging are effectively the same. Just copy a whole folder in the repository to somewhere else in the repository using the <code>svn copy</code> command.</p>

<p>Basically this means that it is by convention what copying a folder means - whether it be a backup, tag, branch or whater. Depending upon how you want to think about things (normally depending upon which SCM tool you have used in the past) you need to set up a folder structure within your repository to support your style.</p>

<p>Common styles are to have a bunch of folders at the top of your repository called <code>tags</code>, <code>branches</code>, <code>trunk</code>, etc. - that allows you to copy your whole <code>trunk</code> (or sub-sets) into the <code>tags</code> and/or <code>branches</code> folders. If you have more than one project you might want to replicate this kind of structure under each project:</p>

<p>It can take a while to get used to the concept - but it works - just make sure you (and your team) are clear on the conventions that you are going to use. It is also a good idea to have a good naming convention - something that tells you why the branch/tag was made and whether it is still appropriate - consider ways of archiving branches that are obsolete.</p>

<p>Whatever your [things] are need to be written outside of VBScript.</p>

<p>In VB6, <a href="http://www.vb-helper.com/howto_custom_collection_with_for_each.html" rel="nofollow">you can write a Custom Collection class</a>, then you'll need to compile to an ActiveX DLL and register it on your webserver to access it.</p>
<p>Right-click on the Source view of an HTML / ASP page and select "Formatting and Validation".</p>

<ol>
<li>Click "Tag Specific Options".</li>
<li>Expand "Client HTML Tags" and select the heading.</li>
<li>Click "New Tag...".</li>
<li>And just fill it in!</li>
</ol>

<p>I wish that I could add custom CSS values as well.</p>

<p>Do you need to open the locfile in binary using <code>rb</code>?</p>

<pre><code>f = open (locfile, "rb")
</code></pre>

<p>Well if you go under the properties of your file in Windows or a *nix environment, you will notice two sizes.  One is the sector size, and one is the actual size.  The sector size is the number of sectors in bytes that are used up on your hard disk.  That is because two files cannot be in the same sector with most modern file systems, so if your file fills up half of the sector the whole sector is marked as filled.</p>

<p>So you might be comparing the sector file size to the actual file size on the FTP server or vice versa.</p>
<p>Make sure that the file has svn:keywords "Rev Id" and then put $Rev$ somewhere in there.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/163/how-do-i-sync-the-svn-revision-number-with-my-aspnet-web-site" rel="nofollow">this question and the answers to it</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to populate each member variable by hand you can generalize it a bit as far as the primitives are concerned by using FormatterServices to retrieve in order the list of variable types associated with an object. I've had to do this in a project where I had a lot of different message types coming off the stream and I definitely didn't want to write the serializer/deserializer for each message. </p>

<p>Here's the code I used to generalize the deserialization from a byte[].</p>

<pre><code>public virtual bool SetMessageBytes(byte[] message)<br>    {<br>        MemberInfo[] members = FormatterServices.GetSerializableMembers(this.GetType());<br>        object[] values = FormatterServices.GetObjectData(this, members);<br>        int j = 0;<br><br>        for (int i = 0; i &lt; members.Length; i++)<br>        {<br>            string[] var = members[i].ToString().Split(new char[] { ' ' });<br>            switch (var[0])<br>            {<br>                case "UInt32":<br>                    values[i] = (UInt32)((message[j] &lt;&lt; 24) + (message[j + 1] &lt;&lt; 16) + (message[j + 2] &lt;&lt; 8) + message[j + 3]);<br>                    j += 4;<br>                    break;<br>                case "UInt16":<br>                    values[i] = (UInt16)((message[j] &lt;&lt; 8) + message[j + 1]);<br>                    j += 2;<br>                    break;<br>                case "Byte":<br>                    values[i] = (byte)message[j++];<br>                    break;<br>                case "UInt32[]":<br>                    if (values[i] != null)<br>                    {<br>                        int len = ((UInt32[])values[i]).Length;<br>                        byte[] b = new byte[len * 4];<br>                        Array.Copy(message, j, b, 0, len * 4);<br>                        Array.Copy(Utilities.ByteArrayToUInt32Array(b), (UInt32[])values[i], len);<br>                        j += len * 4;<br>                    }<br>                    break;<br>                case "Byte[]":<br>                    if (values[i] != null)<br>                    {<br>                        int len = ((byte[])values[i]).Length;<br>                        Array.Copy(message, j, (byte[])(values[i]), 0, len);<br>                        j += len;<br>                    }<br>                    break;<br>                default:<br>                    throw new Exception("ByteExtractable::SetMessageBytes Unsupported Type: " + var[1] + " is of type " +  var[0]);<br>            }<br>        }<br>        FormatterServices.PopulateObjectMembers(this, members, values);<br>        return true;<br>    }<br></code></pre>
<p>As long as the two databases are on the same physical server (assuming MSSQL) and the username/password being used in the connection string has rights to both DBs, then you should be able to perform a join across the two databases. Example: </p>

<pre><code>select p.Date,<br>       p.Amount,<br>       d.SoftwareName,<br>       d.DownloadLink<br>from   PurchaseDB.dbo.Purchases as p<br>join   ProductDB.dbo.Products as d on d.sku = p.sku<br>where  p.UserID = 12345 <br></code></pre>
<p>Go to TextWrangler &gt; Preferences.</p>

<p>Choose Text Status Display in the category pane, then check the option "Show line numbers"  and close the preferences. This should now be on by default when you open existing documents.</p>
<p>You can also use the backtick operators (`), similar to Perl:</p>

<pre><code>directoryListing = `ls /`<br>puts directoryListing # prints the contents of the root directory<br></code></pre>

<p>Handy if you need something simple.</p>

<p>Which method you want to use depends on exactly what you're trying to accomplish; check the docs for more details about the different methods.</p>
<P>There is nothing VS specific with the MVC framework - it is just a bunch of DLLs that you can use. The wizards in VS just build you a quick-start framework.</P>
<P>ASP.NET MVC is "bin-deployable" - there is nothing too clever to set up on the server either - just point the wildcard ISAPI filter to ASP.NET</P>
<p>The search seems to be an "OR" instead of an "AND" :-( If you do a search for ASP.NET SVN on the search bar, you will not find it on Page 6 or so.</p>

<p>it definitely should get some refining.</p>
<p>Why not create a Domain object based approach to this problem:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomerDownloadInfo<br>{<br>    private string sku;<br>    private readonly ICustomer customer;<br><br>    public CustomerDownloadInfo(ICustomer Customer){<br>        customer = Customer;<br>    }<br><br>    public void AttachSku(string Sku){<br>        sku = Sku;<br>    }<br><br>    public string Sku{<br>        get { return sku; }<br>    }<br><br>    public string Link{<br>        get{    <br>            // etc... etc...          <br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>There are a million variations on this, but once you aggregate this information, wouldn't it be easier to present?</p>
<p>The way I like to do this is using the <code>%x</code> literal, which makes it easy (and readable!) to use quotes in a command, like so:</p>

<pre><code>directorylist = %x[find . -name '*test.rb' | sort]
</code></pre>

<p>Which, in this case, will populate file list with all test files under the current directory, which you can process as expected:</p>

<pre><code>directorylist.each do |filename|
  filename.chomp!
  # work with file
end
</code></pre>

<p>Go to System Preferences &gt; Keyboard and Mouse, then choose Keyboard Shortcuts. At the bottom, ensure Full Keyboard Access is set to "All controls". It's a long time since I turned it on but I think that's all you need to do</p>

<p>Change the radio button at the bottom from "Text boxes and lists only" to "All controls."</p>

<p>Edit: Dammit. We're a fast group around here aren't we? :-)</p>
<p>This is an alternative way (DataReader is faster than this one):</p>

<pre><code>string s = "";<br>SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Server=192.168.1.1;Database=master;Connect Timeout=30;User ID=foobar;Password=raboof;");<br>SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT TOP 5 name, dbid FROM sysdatabases", conn);<br>DataTable dt = new DataTable();<br><br>da.Fill(dt);<br><br>for (int i = 0; i &lt; dt.Rows.Count; i++)<br>{<br>    s += dt.Rows[i]["name"].ToString() + " -- " + dt.Rows[i]["dbid"].ToString() + "\n";<br>}<br><br>MessageBox.Show(s);<br></code></pre>
<p>Step one is to make your "dirty" pieces self contained user controls</p>

<p>Step two is to embed those controls on your consuming page</p>

<p>Step three is to wrap each user control tag in their own Asp:UpdatePanel</p>

<p>Step four is to ensure your control gets the data it needs by having it read from properties which check against the viewstate for pre-existing values. I know this makes your code rely on ugly global variables but it's a fast way to get this done.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/controls/ajax/overview.aspx" rel="nofollow">RadAjax</a> control from Telerik - it allows you to avoid using UpdatePanels, and limit the amount of info passed back and forth between server and client by declaring direct relationships between calling controls, and controls that should be "Ajaxified" when the calling controls submit postbacks. </p>
<p>As previous posters have said, it's a matter for the project. You will find that some are more open to change than others. From a mechanical perspective, you will need to see if they use SVN (for example on google code) or CVS (for example on sourceforge) and determine if they use patch or some other method.</p>

<p>A good example of the sort of procedure you might need to employ can be seen on the gimp site: <a href="http://www.gimp.org/bugs/howtos/submit-patch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/bugs/howtos/submit-patch.html</a>
Note their use of Bugzilla, patch and CVS</p>

<p>All of the tech podcasts I listen to have been mentioned, but as long as we're discussing video I'd like to mention <a href="http://www.hak5.org/" rel="nofollow">Hak.5</a>.  It is more focused on using existing programs rather than coding, but it has some good hardware segments, and it can often be an excellent source of inspiration.</p>
<P>The easiest way to grok them (at least for me) is as "decorators", adding behavior while preserving the underlying semantics. Or, an even dirtier definition: it's functional programming's operator overloading.</P>
<p>Unit test, for me, has been something of a mixed blessing.  </p>

<p>I have been in the situation where I must write unit tests for several years now, and I totally see the advantage for a clean and efficient development cycle, however these are some of the issues I have faced.</p>

<ul>
<li>Development may be clean, but when requirements change, you often have to start again at the unit test level.  This is, of course, a process issue rather than a TDD one.</li>
<li>Testing GUI stuff is nigh on impossible OOTB with most tools</li>
<li>There is a large amount of self-discipline required to make sure you use best practice.  It is unfortunate but it's very easy to fall away from test-driven to "test-supported" development.  By that I mean starting off with the best of intentions, but not sticking to the idea of writing your test first.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all, though, I am in favour of using unit testing to improve stability, reliability, brevity and general quality of your code.  Regression testing is a huge area for unit tests to come into their own, and I sure hope someone else can explain their views on that a little better than I can.  :)</p>

<p>Why not use <code>For Each</code>?  That way you don't need to care what the <code>LBound</code> and <code>UBound</code> are.</p>

For Each y In x
    z = DoSomethingWith(y)

<p>This is like many other languages, including Bash, PHP, and Perl.</p>

<p>Returns the result of the shell command.</p>

<p>Docs: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-60">http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-60</a></p>

<pre><code>value = `echo 'hi'`
value = `#{cmd}`
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Built-in syntax, <code>%x( cmd )</code></p>

<p>Following the <code>x</code> character is a delimiter, which can be any character.
If the delimiter is one of the characters <code>(</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>{</code>, or <code>&lt;</code>,
the literal consists of the characters up to the matching closing delimiter,
taking account of nested delimiter pairs. For all other delimiters, the
literal comprises the characters up to the next occurrence of the
delimiter character.  String interpolation <code>#{ ... }</code> is allowed.</p>

<p>Returns the result of the shell command, just like the backticks.</p>

<p>Docs: <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/language.html">http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/language.html</a></p>

<pre><code>value = %x( echo 'hi' )
value = %x[ #{cmd} ]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>Kernel#system</code></p>

<p>Executes the given command in a subshell. </p>

<p>Returns <code>true</code> if the command was found and ran successfully, <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Docs: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-system">http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-system</a></p>

<pre><code>wasGood = system( "echo 'hi'" )
wasGood = system( cmd )
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>Kernel#exec</code></p>

<p>Replaces the current process by running the given external command.</p>

<p>Returns none, the current process is replaced and never continues.</p>

<p>Docs: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-exec">http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-exec</a></p>

<pre><code>exec( "echo 'hi'" )
exec( cmd ) # Note: this will never be reached because of the line above
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's some extra advice:
<code>$?</code>, which is the same as <code>$CHILD_STATUS</code>, accesses the status of the last system executed command if you use the backticks, <code>system()</code> or <code>%x{}</code>.
You can then access the <code>exitstatus</code> and <code>pid</code> properties:</p>

<pre><code>$?.exitstatus
</code></pre>

<p>You should make your choice of server platform based on the environment as a whole, and that includes the admin/management interfaces supplied.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that if you don't like the way Windows implements management of IIS, then that's too bad.  Having said that, a bit of delving around in the WMI interfaces will generally yield a solution that you should find usable.  I used to do quite a bit of WMI scripting (mostly via PowerShell) in order to have a reliable environment rebuild capability.</p>
<p>I actually found both of those links you provided, but as noted they are simply describing the problem, not solving it. The author of the blog post suggests a workaround by using a different ViewState provider, but unfortunately that isn't a possibility in this case...I really need to leave the particulars of the ViewState alone and just hook on to what is being done out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open))<br>{<br>    BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();<br>    StructType aStruct = (StructType)formatter.Deserialize(filestream);<br>}<br></code></pre>
<p>I have never come across this kind of situation, and to be honest the idea of referencing > 256 tables in a query fils me with a mortal dread.  </p>

<p>Your first question should probably by "Why so many?", closely followed by "what bits of information do I <em>NOT</em> need?"  I'd be worried that the amount of data being returned from such a query would begin to impact performance of the application quite severely, too.</p>
<p>I'd like to see that query, but I imagine it's some problem with some sort of iterator, and while I can't think of any situations where its possible, I bet it's from a bad while/case/cursor or a ton of poorly implemented views.</p>
<p>Not comprehensive, but useful nonetheless: <a href="http://www.wotsit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wotsit.org/</a></p>

<p>Using the example you gave:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;<br>&lt;input type="text" name="field1" /&gt;&lt;!-- put your cursor in this field and press Enter --&gt;<br>&lt;input type="submit" name="prev" value="Previous Page" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is the button that will submit --&gt;<br>&lt;input type="submit" name="next" value="Next Page" /&gt; &lt;!-- But this is the button that I WANT to submit --&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>If you click on "Previous Page" only the value of "prev" will be submitted. If you click on "Next Page" only the value of "next" will be submitted.</p>

<p>If however, you press enter somewhere on the form, neither "prev" nor "next" will be submitted.</p>

<p>So using pseudo code you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>If "prev" submitted then<br>    Previous Page was click<br>Else If "next" submitted then<br>    Next Page was click<br>Else<br>    No button was click<br></code></pre>
<p>@chopeen You could change the way you're calculating these statistics, and instead keep a separate table of all per-product stats.. when an order is placed, loop through the products and update the appropriate records in the stats table.  This would shift a lot of the calculation load to the checkout page rather than running everything in one huge query when running a report.  Of course there are some stats that aren't going to work as well this way, e.g. tracking customers' next purchases after purchasing a particular product.</p>
<p>For SQL Server 2005, I'd recommend using table variables and partially building the data as you go. </p>

<p>To do this, create a table variable that represents your final result set you want to send to the user.</p>

<p>Then find your primary table (say the orders table in your example above) and pull that data, plus a bit of supplementary data that is only say one join away (customer name, product name). You can do a SELECT INTO to put this straight into your table variable.</p>

<p>From there, iterate through the table and for each row, do a bunch of small SELECT queries that retrieves all the supplemental data you need for your result set. Insert these into each column as you go.</p>

<p>Once complete, you can then do a simple SELECT * from your table variable and return this result set to the user.</p>

<p>I don't have any hard numbers for this, but there have been three distinct instances that I have worked on to date where doing these smaller queries has actually worked faster than doing one massive select query with a bunch of joins.</p>
<p>Post the query :D</p>

<p>Also I feel like one of the possible problems could be having a ton (read 200+) of name/value tables which could condensed into a single lookup table.</p>
<p>A VirtualHost would also work for this and may work better for you as you can host several projects without the need for subdirectories.  Here's how you do it:</p>

<p>httpd.conf (or extra\httpd-vhosts.conf relative to httpd.conf. Trailing slashes "\" might cause it not to work):</p>

<pre><code>NameVirtualHost *:80<br># ...<br>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;  <br>    DocumentRoot C:\projects\transitCalculator\trunk\<br>    ServerName transitcalculator.localhost<br>    &lt;Directory C:\projects\transitCalculator\trunk\&gt;  <br>        Order allow,deny  <br>        Allow from all  <br>    &lt;/Directory&gt;<br>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt; <br></code></pre>

<p>HOSTS file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts usually):</p>

<pre><code># localhost entries<br>127.0.0.1 localhost transitcalculator.localhost<br></code></pre>

<p>Now restart XAMPP and you should be able to access http://transitcalculator.localhost/ and it will map straight to that directory.</p>

<p>This can be helpful if you're trying to replicate a production environment where you're developing a site that will sit on the root of a domain name.  You can, for example, point to files with absolute paths that will carry over to the server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="/images/logo.png" alt="My Logo" /&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>whereas in an environment using aliases or subdirectories, you'd need keep track of exactly where the "images" directory was relative to the current file.</p>
<p>I don't see any problem with your code.</p>

<p>just out of my head, what if you try to do it manually? does it work?</p>

<pre><code>BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(stream);<br>StructType o = new StructType();<br>o.FileDate = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(reader.ReadBytes(8));<br>o.FileTime = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(reader.ReadBytes(8));<br>...<br>...<br>...<br></code></pre>

<p>also try</p>

<pre><code>StructType o = new StructType();<br>byte[] buffer = new byte[Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(StructType))];<br>GCHandle handle = GCHandle.Alloc(buffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);<br>Marshal.StructureToPtr(o, handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), false);<br>handle.Free();<br></code></pre>

<p>then use <strong>buffer[]</strong> in your BinaryReader instead of reading data from FileStream to see whether you still get AccessViolation exception.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had no luck using the
  BinaryFormatter, I guess I have to
  have a complete struct that matches
  the content of the file exactly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That makes sense, BinaryFormatter has its own data format, completely incompatible with yours.</p>
<p>I suppose you could compare the ad prints with the page views on your website (which you can get from your analytics software).</p>
<p>Since programs like AdBlock actually never request the advert, you would have to look the server logs to see if the same user accessed a webpage but didn't access an advert. This is assuming the advert is on the same server.</p>

<p>If your adverts are on a separate server, then I would suggest it's impossible to do so.</p>

<p>The best way to stop users from blocking adverts, is to have inline text adverts which are generated by the server and dished up inside your html.</p>
<p>Add the user id to the request for the ad:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="./ads/viagra.jpg?{user.id}"/&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>that way you can check what ads are seen by which users.</p>
<p>You need to think about the different ways that ads are blocked. The first thing to look at is whether they are running noscript, so you could add a script that would check for that. </p>

<p>The next thing is to see if they are blocking flash, a small movie should do that.</p>

<p>If you look at the adblock site, there is some indication of how it does blocking:<br>
<a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/faq_internal#elemhide" rel="nofollow">How does element hiding work?</a></p>

<p>If you look further down that page, you will see that conventional chrome probing will not work, so you need to try and parse the altered DOM.</p>

<p>The former will throw an exception if the source type can't be cast to the target type. The latter will result in sc2 being a null reference, but no exception.</p>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>My original answer is certainly the most pronounced difference, but as Eric Lippert <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/10/08/what-s-the-difference-between-as-and-cast-operators.aspx">points out</a>, it's not the only one. Other differences include:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can't use the 'as' operator to cast to a type that doesn't accept 'null' as a value</li>
<li>You can't use 'as' to <em>convert</em> things, like numbers to a different representation (float to int, for example).</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, using 'as' vs. the cast operator, you're also saying "I'm not sure if this will succeed." </p>

<p>The parenthetical cast throws an exception if the cast attempt fails. The "as" cast returns null if the cast attempt fails.</p>
<p>Most people use .NET serialization (there is faster binary and slower XML formatter, they both depend on reflection and are version tolerant to certain degree)</p>

<p>However, if you want the fastest (unsafe) way - why not:</p>

<p>Writing:</p>

<pre><code>YourStruct o = new YourStruct();
byte[] buffer = new byte[Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(YourStruct))];
GCHandle handle = GCHandle.Alloc(buffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
Marshal.StructureToPtr(o, handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), false);
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<p>Reading:</p>

<pre><code>handle = GCHandle.Alloc(buffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
o = (YourStruct)Marshal.PtrToStructure(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), typeof(YourStruct));
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<p>I've honestly never read it myself, but <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201310090">Concurrent Programming in Java</a> is a book I've heard recommended by several people.</p>
<p>Alright. From a theoretical point of view, given that the distortion is "arbitrary", and any solution requires you to model this arbitrary distortion, you obviously can't get an "answer". However, any solution is going to involve imposing (usually implicitly) some model of the distortion that may or may not reflect the reality of the situation.</p>

<p>Since you seem to be most interested in models that presume some sort of local continuity of the distortion mapping, the most obvious choice is the one you've already tried: linear interpolaton between the nearest points. Going beyond that is going to require more sophisticated mathematical and numerical analysis knowledge.</p>

<p>You are incorrect, however, in presuming you cannot expand this to more points. You can by using a least-squared error approach. Find the linear answer that minimizes the error of the other points. This is probably the most straight-forward extension. In other words, take the 5 nearest points and try to come up with a linear approximation that minimizes the error of those points. And use that. I would try this next.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, then the assumption of linearity over the area of N points is broken. At that point you'll need to upgrade to either a quadratic or cubic model. The math is going to get hectic at that point.</p>
<p>I believe <a href="http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/" rel="nofollow">DB Designer</a> does something like that.  And I think they even have a free version.</p>

<p><em>edit</em>
Never mind.  Michael's link is much better.</p>
<p>Try MySQL Workbench, formerly DBDesigner 4:</p>

<p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/workbench/">http://dev.mysql.com/workbench/</a></p>

<p>This has a "Reverse Engineer Database" mode as far as I remember:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cilk.com/multicore-e-book/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cilk.com/multicore-e-book/</a></p>

<p>That's a nice general overview of the sitution, if you're looking for tuorials and books it might be best to specify a language as a starting point so you can mess around with some code.</p>
<p>They'll throw different exceptions. <br>
() : NullReferenceException <br>
as : InvalidCastException <br>
Which could help for debugging.</p>

<p>The "as" keyword attempts to cast the object and if the cast fails, null is returned silently. The () cast operator will throw an exception immediately if the cast fails.</p>

<p>"Only use the C# "as" keyword where you are expecting the cast to fail in a non-exceptional case. If you are counting on a cast to succeed and are unprepared to receive any object that would fail, you should use the () cast operator so that an appropriate and helpful exception is thrown."</p>

<p>For code examples and a further explanation: <a href="http://blog.nerdbank.net/2008/06/when-not-to-use-c-keyword.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.nerdbank.net/2008/06/when-not-to-use-c-keyword.html</a></p>
<p>The two self-balancing <code>BST</code>s I'm most familiar with are red-black and <code>AVL</code>, so I can't say for certain if any other solutions are better, but as I recall, red-black has faster insertion and slower retrieval compared to <code>AVL</code>. </p>

<p>So if insertion is a higher priority than retrieval, red-black may be a better solution.</p>

<p>As you've said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To me, that seems a bit overkill, since viewing the site without Javascript will probably break most of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't progressive enhancement. Progressive enhancement is when the site works perfectly without JavaScript or CSS, and <em>then</em> adding (layering) these extra technologies/code to increase the usability and functionality of the website.</p>

<p>The best example I can give is the tag input box on this website. With JavaScript turned off, it would still work allowing you to enter tags separated with a space. With JavaScript turned on, you get a drop down with suggestions of previous entries.</p>

<p>This is progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="http://nettuts.com/javascript-ajax/creating-a-dynamic-poll-with-jquery-and-php/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> on creating a poll that used progressive enhancement at <a href="http://nettuts.com/" rel="nofollow">NETTUTS</a>. The idea is to create a functional site using XHTML/CSS and PHP, and then intercept forms etc with Javascript. (I used JQuery).</p>
<p>Going at it from the other direction is sometimes referred to as graceful degradation.  This is usually needed when the site is built first with the enhanced functionality afforded by the various technologies then modified to degrade gracefully for browsers with those technologies are not available.</p>

<p>It is also graceful degradation when designing to work with older browsers (ancient in the Internets terminology) such as IE 5.5, Netscape, etc...</p>

<p>In my opinion it is much more work to gracefully degrade the application.  Progressively enhancing it tends to be much more efficient; however, sometimes the need to take an existing app and make it accessible in these lacking environments arise.</p>
<p>Small files take up a whole node on the filesystem whatever size that is.</p>

<p>My host tends to report all small files as 4kb in ftp but in a shell gives an accurate size so it might be a 'feature' common to ftp clients.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree" rel="nofollow">Red-black</a> is better than AVL for insertion-heavy applications. If you foresee relatively uniform look-up, then Red-black is the way to go. If you foresee a relatively unbalanced look-up where more recently viewed elements are more likely to be viewed again, you want to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree" rel="nofollow">splay trees</a>.</p>

<p>Not practicing BDD myself though.</p>

<p>The "Reverse Engineer Database" mode in Workbench is only part of the paid version, not the free one.</p>

<p>It seems to me that BDD is a broader scope.  It almost implies TDD is used, that BDD is the encompasing methodology that gathers the information and requirements for using, amongh other things, TDD practices to ensure rapid feedback.</p>
<p>Things like this used to be simple.</p>

<p>There was a mailing list for users and one for developers.  If you see a problem and can fix it fix it and then run Larry Wall's Patch and send the resulting patch to the devs list with a quick explanation of what it does.  Generally a dev with write access to the CVS (or in the real old days whose floppy the project resided on ;) ) would check things over and if your patch does what it says on the tin and doesn't break anything else it gets into the source tree proper.</p>

<p>These days there are many, many more projects using open development and lots of them are run by people who have never run a software project before let alone an open sourced one so things can be more tricky.  Generally mailing a patch to someone doing lots of dev in the right area of the project gets the right eyes looking at it quickly even today.  A browse of the online repository will tell you the folks who do the work rather than those who get their names on the front page of the web site, contact those guys first :)</p>
<p>Also note that you can only use the as keyword with a reference type or a nullable type</p>

<p>ie:</p>

<pre><code>double d = 5.34;<br>int i = d as int;<br></code></pre>

<p>will not compile</p>

<pre><code>double d = 5.34;<br>int i = (int)d;<br></code></pre>

<p>will compile.</p>
<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321486811">The Dragon Book</a> is definitely the "building compilers" book, but if your language isn't quite as complicated as the current generation of languages, you may want to look at the Interpreter pattern from <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201633612">Design Patterns</a>.</p>

<p>The example in the book designs a regular expression-like language and is well thought through, but as they say in the book, it's good for thinking through the process but is effective really only on small languages. However, it is much faster to write an Interpreter for a small language with this pattern than having to learn about all the different types of parsers, yacc and lex, et cetera...</p>
<p>I have been using smartassembly. Basically, you pick a dll and it returns it obfuscated. It seems to work fine and I've had no problems so far. Very, very easy to use.</p>
<p>Firefox 30 ignores <code>autocomplete="off"</code> for passwords, opting to prompt the user instead whether the password should be stored on the client. Note the following <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=956906#c100">commentary</a> from May 5, 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The password manager <em>always</em> prompts if it wants to save a password. Passwords are not saved without permission from the user.</li>
  <li>We are the third browser to implement this change, after IE and Chrome.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/How_to_Turn_Off_Form_Autocompletion">Mozilla developer documentation</a> the form element attribute <code>autocomplete</code> prevents form data from being cached in older browsers.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="foo" autocomplete="off" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;form autocomplete="off" ...<br></code></pre>

<p>was a none standard way to do this (I think mozilla and IE still support it) but messing with the users expectations is normally a bad idea.  </p>

<p>If the user enters their credit card details into a form and then let's someone else use that browser it's not your concern :)</p>
<p>Use a non-standard name and id for the fields, so rather than "name" have "name_". Browsers will then not see it as being the name field. The best part about it is that you can do this to some but not all fields and it will autocomplete some but not all fields.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form name="form1" id="form1" method="post" 
      autocomplete="off" action="http://www.example.com/form.cgi"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will work in IE and FF, the downside is that it is not XHTML standard.</p>

<p>But, <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html">You could have invented Monads!</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sigfpe says:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>But all of these introduce monads as something esoteric in need of explanation. But what I want to argue is that they aren't esoteric at all. In fact, faced with various problems in functional programming you would have been led, inexorably, to certain solutions, all of which are examples of monads. In fact, I hope to get you to invent them now if you haven't already. It's then a small step to notice that all of these solutions are in fact the same solution in disguise. And after reading this, you might be in a better position to understand other documents on monads because you'll recognise everything you see as something you've already invented.</p>
    
    <p>Many of the problems that monads try to solve are related to the issue of side effects. So we'll start with them. (Note that monads let you do more than handle side-effects, in particular many types of container object can be viewed as monads. Some of the introductions to monads find it hard to reconcile these two different uses of monads and concentrate on just one or the other.)</p>
    
    <p>In an imperative programming language such as C++, functions behave nothing like the functions of mathematics. For example, suppose we have a C++ function that takes a single floating point argument and returns a floating point result. Superficially it might seem a little like a mathematical function mapping reals to reals, but a C++ function can do more than just return a number that depends on its arguments. It can read and write the values of global variables as well as writing output to the screen and receiving input from the user. In a pure functional language, however, a function can only read what is supplied to it in its arguments and the only way it can have an effect on the world is through the values it returns.</p>

<p>Just set <code>autocomplete="off"</code>. There is a very good reason for doing this: You want to provide your own autocomplete functionality!</p>

<p>It sounds like you are probably hitting F5 in Visual Studio when you receive this error?</p>

<p>There are a few things you can try.  The easiest is to hit the <strong>Stop</strong> button before hitting F5.  Optionally, when you are finished debugging and starting to make changes you can go to the <strong>Debug</strong> menu and choose either <strong>Stop Debugging</strong> or <strong>Terminate All</strong>.</p>
<p>It sounds like something is eating up your web server's resources.  Perhaps you have some resources (file handlers, wcf proxies) that are being opened and not closed? I've had this happen to me specifically when I was not closing WCF client proxy connections.</p>

<p>The problem is not necessarily that you have a debugger attached, but only that the web server is not responding in a timely manner.  Note that the message says "This <strong>may</strong> be because another debugger is attached".</p>
<p>You can add a mouse click event to the TreeView, then select the correct node using GetNodeAt given the mouse coordinates provided by the MouseEventArgs.</p>

<pre><code>void treeView1MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    if(e.Button == MouseButtons.Right)
    {
        // Select the clicked node
        treeView1.SelectedNode = treeView1.GetNodeAt(e.X, e.Y);

        if(treeView1.SelectedNode != null)
        {
            myContextMenuStrip.Show(treeView1, e.Location);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

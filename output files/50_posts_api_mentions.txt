Well, here's how we do it on Stack Overflow.

var ts = new TimeSpan(DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks - dt.Ticks);
double delta = Math.Abs(ts.TotalSeconds);

if (delta < 60)
{
  return ts.Seconds == 1 ? "one second ago" : ts.Seconds + " seconds ago";
}
if (delta < 120)
{
  return "a minute ago";
}
if (delta < 2700) // 45 * 60
{
  return ts.Minutes + " minutes ago";
}
if (delta < 5400) // 90 * 60
{
  return "an hour ago";
}
if (delta < 86400) // 24 * 60 * 60
{
  return ts.Hours + " hours ago";
}
if (delta < 172800) // 48 * 60 * 60
{
  return "yesterday";
}
if (delta < 2592000) // 30 * 24 * 60 * 60
{
  return ts.Days + " days ago";
}
if (delta < 31104000) // 12 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60
{
  int months = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor((double)ts.Days / 30));
  return months <= 1 ? "one month ago" : months + " months ago";
}
int years = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor((double)ts.Days / 365));
return years <= 1 ? "one year ago" : years + " years ago";


Suggestions? Comments? Ways to improve this algorithm?

What is the difference between Math.Floor() and Math.Truncate() in .NET?

How do you expose a LINQ query as an ASMX web service? Usually, from the business tier, I can return a typed DataSet or DataTable which can be serialized for transport over ASMX.

How can I do the same for a LINQ query? Is there a way to populate a typed DataSet or DataTable via a LINQ query?: 

public static MyDataTable CallMySproc()    
{    
    string conn = ...;

    MyDatabaseDataContext db = new MyDatabaseDataContext(conn);    
    MyDataTable dt = new MyDataTable();

    // execute a sproc via LINQ
    var query = from dr in db.MySproc().AsEnumerable
    select dr;

    // copy LINQ query resultset into a DataTable -this does not work !    
    dt = query.CopyToDataTable();

    return dt;
}


How can I get the resultset of a LINQ query into a DataSet or DataTable? Alternatively, is the LINQ query serializeable so that I can expose it as an ASMX web service?

For a table like this:

    bin_data LONGBLOB,

    filesize CHAR(50),
    filetype CHAR(50)

                mysql_connect("localhost", "root", "password");
                mysql_select_db("binary_data");

                $data = mysql_real_escape_string(fread(fopen($form_data, "r"), filesize($form_data)));

Solutions are welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of Ï€, as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using #defined constants like M_PI, or hard-coding the number in.

The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest.

Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c):

#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

#define ITERS 10000000
#define TESTWITH(x) {                                                       \
    diff = 0.0;                                                             \
    time1 = clock();                                                        \
    for (i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i)                                             \
        diff += (x) - M_PI;                                                 \
    time2 = clock();                                                        \
    printf("%s\t=> %e, time => %f\n", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1));   \
}

static inline double
diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0)
{
    return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
}

int
main()
{
    int i;
    clock_t time1, time2;
    double diff;

    /* Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would
     * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op), if -fno-builtin
     * is not used. */
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))

#if defined(__GNUC__) && (defined(__i386__) || defined(__amd64__))
    extern double fldpi();
    TESTWITH(fldpi())
#endif

    /* Actual tests start here. */
    TESTWITH(atan2(0, -1))
    TESTWITH(acos(-1))
    TESTWITH(2 * asin(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))

    return 0;
}


And the inline assembly stuff (fldpi.c), noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems:

double
fldpi()
{
    double pi;
    asm("fldpi" : "=t" (pi));
    return pi;
}


And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (build.sh):

#!/bin/sh
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m64 -o fldpi-64.o fldpi.c

gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m32 -o pitimes1-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o
gcc -O3 -Wall              -m32 -o pitimes2-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m32 -o pitimes3-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m64 -o pitimes1-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall              -m64 -o pitimes2-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m64 -o pitimes3-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm


Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The atan2(0, -1) version still comes out top every time, though.

Many years ago, to provide an age calculator gimmick on my website, I wrote a function to calculate age to a fraction. This is a quick port of that function to C# (from the PHP version). I'm afraid I haven't been able to test the C# version, but hope you enjoy all the same!

(Admittedly this is a bit gimmicky for the purposes of showing user profiles on Stack Overflow, but maybe readers will find some use for it. :-))

double AgeDiff(DateTime date1, DateTime date2) {    double years = date2.Year - date1.Year;    /*     * If date2 and date1 + round(date2 - date1) are on different sides     * of 29 February, then our partial year is considered to have 366     * days total, otherwise it's 365. Note that 59 is the day number     * of 29 Feb.     */    double fraction = 365            + (DateTime.IsLeapYear(date2.Year) && date2.DayOfYear >= 59            && (date1.DayOfYear < 59 || date1.DayOfYear > date2.DayOfYear)            ? 1 : 0);    /*     * The only really nontrivial case is if date1 is in a leap year,     * and date2 is not. So let's handle the others first.     */    if (DateTime.IsLeapYear(date2.Year) == DateTime.IsLeapYear(date1.Year))        return years + (date2.DayOfYear - date1.DayOfYear) / fraction;    /*     * If date2 is in a leap year, but date1 is not and is March or     * beyond, shift up by a day.     */    if (DateTime.IsLeapYear(date2.Year)) {        return years + (date2.DayOfYear - date1.DayOfYear                - (date1.DayOfYear >= 59 ? 1 : 0)) / fraction;    }    /*     * If date1 is not on 29 February, shift down date1 by a day if     * March or later. Proceed normally.     */    if (date1.DayOfYear != 59) {        return years + (date2.DayOfYear - date1.DayOfYear                + (date1.DayOfYear > 59 ? 1 : 0)) / fraction;    }    /*     * Okay, here date1 is on 29 February, and date2 is not on a leap     * year. What to do now? On 28 Feb in date2's year, the ``age''     * should be just shy of a whole number, and on 1 Mar should be     * just over. Perhaps the easiest way is to a point halfway     * between those two: 58.5.     */    return years + (date2.DayOfYear - 58.5) / fraction;}
The best way that I know of because of leap years and everything is:

DateTime birthDate = new DateTime(2000,3,1);int age = (int)Math.Floor((DateTime.Now - birthDate).TotalDays / 365.25D);

Hope this helps.

IMHO yours seems a little long.  However it does seem a little more robust with support for "yesterday" and "years".  But in my experience when this is used the person is most likely to view the content in the first 30 days.  It is only the really hardcore people that come after that.  So that is why I usually elect to keep this short and simple.

This is the method I am currently using on one of my websites.  This only returns a relative day, hour, time.  And then the user has to slap on "ago" in the output.

public static string ToLongString(this TimeSpan time){    string output = String.Empty;    if (time.Days > 0)        output += time.Days + " days ";    if ((time.Days == 0 || time.Days == 1) && time.Hours > 0)        output += time.Hours + " hr ";    if (time.Days == 0 && time.Minutes > 0)        output += time.Minutes + " min ";    if (output.Length == 0)        output += time.Seconds + " sec";    return output.Trim();}
I've had no trouble using the BSD sockets API in C++, in GNU/Linux. Here's the sample program I used:

#include <sys/socket.h>intmain(){    return AF_INET;}

So my take on this is that z/OS is probably the complicating factor here, however, because I've never used z/OS before, much less programmed in it, I can't say this definitively. :-P
How do I forcefully unload a ByteArray from memory in ActionScript 3?

I have tried (without success):

byteArray.length = 0;
byteArray = new ByteArray();


And

for ( var i:int=0; i < byteArray.length; i++ ) {
    byteArray[i] = null;
}


How can I monitor an SQL Server database for changes to a table without using triggers or modifying the structure of the database in any way? My preferred programming environment is .NET and C#.

I'd like to be able to support any SQLÂ Server 2000 SP4 or newer. My application is a bolt-on data visualization for another company's product. Our customer base is in the thousands, so I don't want to have to put in requirements that we modify the third-party vendor's table at every installation.

By "changes to a table" I mean changes to table data, not changes to table structure.

Ultimately, I would like the change to trigger an event in my application, instead of having to check for changes at an interval.



The best course of action given my requirements (no triggers or schema modification, SQLÂ Server 2000 and 2005) seems to be to use the BINARY_CHECKSUM function in T-SQL. The way I plan to implement is this:

Every X seconds run the following query:

SELECT CHECKSUM_AGG(BINARY_CHECKSUM(*)) FROM sample_table WITH (NOLOCK);


and compare that against the stored value. If the value has changed, go through the table row by row using the query

select row_id,BINARY_CHECKSUM(*) from sample_table WITH (NOLOCK);


and compare the returned checksums against stored values.

Sure I can post a test app.

#include <sys/socket.h>int main(){    return AF_INET;}

Compile/Link Output:

cxx -Wc,xplink -Wl,xplink -o inet_test inet.C

"./inet.C", line 5.16: CCN5274 (S) The name lookup for "AF_INET" did not find a declaration.

CCN0797(I) Compilation failed for file ./inet.C. Object file not created.

A check of sys/sockets.h does include the definition I need, and as far as I can tell, it is not being blocked by any #ifdef statements.

I have however noticed it contains a the following:

#ifdef __cplusplus  extern "C" {#endif

which encapsulates basically the whole file. Not sure if it matters.
Consider using a ManualResetEvent to block the main thread at the end of its processing, and call Reset() on it once the timer's processing has finished.  If this is something that needs to run constantly, consider moving this into a service process instead of a console app.

You can use something like Console.ReadLine() to block the main thread, so other background threads (like timer threads) will still work. You may also use an AutoResetEvent to block the execution, then (when you need to) you can call Set() method on that AutoResetEvent object to release the main thread. Also ensure that your reference to Timer object doesn't go out of scope and garbage collected.

Have a look at this article

http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2006/06/as3_resource_ma.html

IANA actionscript programmer, however the feeling I'm getting is that, because the garbage collector might not run when you want it to.

Hence
http://www.craftymind.com/2008/04/09/kick-starting-the-garbage-collector-in-actionscript-3-with-air/

So I'd recommend trying out their collection code and see if it helps

private var gcCount:int;private function startGCCycle():void{    gcCount = 0;    addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doGC);}private function doGC(evt:Event):void{    flash.system.System.gc();    if(++gcCount > 1){        removeEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, doGC);        setTimeout(lastGC, 40);    }}private function lastGC():void{    flash.system.System.gc();}
(I'm not positive about this, but...)

AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection. Which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collected languages (like C# and Java as well).

Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by byteArray or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where byteArray is declared.

You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing... if you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help it.

To force a GC, try (yes, twice):

flash.system.System.gc();
flash.system.System.gc();

Give your submit buttons same name like this:

<input type="submit" name="submitButton" value="Previous Page" />
<input type="submit" name="submitButton" value="Next Page" />


When the user presses enter and the Request goes to server, you can check the value for submitButton on your server-side code which contains a collection of form name/value pairs. For example in classic ASP:

If Request.Form("submitButton") = "Previous Page" Then
    ' Code for Previous Page
ElseIf Request.Form("submitButton") = "Next Page" Then
    ' Code for Next Page
End If


Reference: Using multiple submit buttons on a single form

Let's say I have a DataTable with a Name column. I want to have a collection of the unique names ordered alphabetically. The following query ignores the order by clause.

var names =
    (from DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows
    orderby (string)dr["Name"]
    select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct();


Why does the orderby not get enforced?

Unfortunately when it comes to memory management in Flash/actionscript there isn't a whole lot you can do. ActionScript was designed to be easy to use (so they didn't want people to have to worry about memory management)

The following is a workaround, instead of creating a ByteArray variable try this.

var byteObject:Object = new Object();

byteObject.byteArray = new ByteArray();

...

//Then when you are finished delete the variable from byteObject
delete byteObject.byteArray;


Where byteArray is a dynamic property of byteObject, you can free the memory that was allocated for it.

The problem is that the Distinct
 operator does not grant that it will
 maintain the original order of
 values.

So your query will need to work like this

var names = (from DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows
             select (string)dr["Name"]).Distinct().OrderBy( name => name );


It is very simple with the Skip and Take extension methods.

var query = from i in ideas
            select i;

var paggedCollection = query.Skip(startIndex).Take(count);


You could use an Observer pattern.  A simple functional way to accomplish this:

<?php/** Plugin system **/$listeners = array();/* Create an entry point for plugins */function hook(){  global $listeners;  $num_args = func_num_args();  $args = func_get_args();  if($num_args < 2)    trigger_error("Insufficient arguments", E_USER_ERROR);  // Hook name should always be first argument  $hook_name = array_shift($args);  if(!isset($listeners[$hook_name]))    return; // No plugins have registered this hook  foreach($listeners[$hook_name] as $func){    $args = $func($args);   }  return $args;}/* Attach a function to a hook */function add_listener($hook, $function_name){  global $listeners;  $listeners[$hook][] = $function_name;}//////////////////////////** Sample Plugin **/add_listener('a_b', 'my_plugin_func1');add_listener('str', 'my_plugin_func2');function my_plugin_func1($args){  return array(4, 5);}function my_plugin_func2($args){  return str_replace('sample', 'CRAZY', $args[0]);}//////////////////////////** Sample Application **/$a = 1;$b = 2;list($a, $b) = hook('a_b', $a, $b);$str  = "This is my sample application\n";$str .= "$a + $b = ".($a+$b)."\n";$str .= "$a * $b = ".($a*$b)."\n";$str = hook('str', $str);echo $str;?>

Output:

This is my CRAZY application4 + 5 = 94 * 5 = 20

Notes:

For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.

This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.

Sorry, it appears underscore characters are replaced by HTML entities by Markdown?  I can re-post this code when this bug gets fixed.

I've written a database generation script in SQL and want to execute it in my Adobe AIR application:

Create Table tRole (
      roleID integer Primary Key
      ,roleName varchar(40)
);
Create Table tFile (
    fileID integer Primary Key
    ,fileName varchar(50)
    ,fileDescription varchar(500)
    ,thumbnailID integer
    ,fileFormatID integer
    ,categoryID integer
    ,isFavorite boolean
    ,dateAdded date
    ,globalAccessCount integer
    ,lastAccessTime date
    ,downloadComplete boolean
    ,isNew boolean
    ,isSpotlight boolean
    ,duration varchar(30)
);
Create Table tCategory (
    categoryID integer Primary Key
    ,categoryName varchar(50)
    ,parent_categoryID integer
);
...


I execute this in Adobe AIR using the following methods:

public static function RunSqlFromFile(fileName:String):void {
    var file:File = File.applicationDirectory.resolvePath(fileName);
    var stream:FileStream = new FileStream();
    stream.open(file, FileMode.READ)
    var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);
    NonQuery(strSql);
}

public static function NonQuery(strSQL:String):void
{
    var sqlConnection:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection();
    sqlConnection.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(DBPATH);
    var sqlStatement:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement();
    sqlStatement.text = strSQL;
    sqlStatement.sqlConnection = sqlConnection;
    try
    {
        sqlStatement.execute();
    }
    catch (error:SQLError)
    {
        Alert.show(error.toString());
    }
}


No errors are generated, however only tRole exists. It seems that it only looks at the first query (up to the semicolon- if I remove it, the query fails). Is there a way to call multiple queries in one statement?

One framework I'm considering would be for a blogging platform. Since just about any possible view of data you would want would be sorted by date, I was thinking about this structure:

One directory per content node:

./content/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/


Subdirectories of each node including  

/tags  
/authors  
/comments  


As well as simple text files in the node directory for pre- and post-rendered content and the like.

This would allow a simple PHP glob() call (and probably a reversal of the result array) to query on just about anything within the content structure:

glob("content/*/tags/funny");  


Would return paths including all articles tagged "funny".

So I find myself porting a game, that was originally written for the Win32 API, to Linux (well, porting the OS X port of the Win32 port to Linux). I have implemented QueryPerformanceCounter by giving the uSeconds since the process start up:  

BOOL QueryPerformanceCounter(LARGE_INTEGER* performanceCount)
{
    gettimeofday(Â¤tTimeVal, NULL);
    performanceCount->QuadPart = (currentTimeVal.tv_sec - startTimeVal.tv_sec);
    performanceCount->QuadPart *= (1000 * 1000);
    performanceCount->QuadPart += (currentTimeVal.tv_usec - startTimeVal.tv_usec);

    return true;
}


This, coupled with QueryPerformanceFrequency() giving a constant 1000000 as the frequency, works well on my machine, giving me a 64 bit variable that contains uSeconds since the program's start up. So is this portable? I don't want to discover it works differently if the kernel was compiled in a certain way or anything like that. I am fine with it being non-portable to something other than Linux, however.

One way to store flat-file content would be to save literal arrays to php files.  For example:

$data = array();

if( $_POST ) {
    $data = $_POST;

    $content = "<?php\n";
    $content .= '$data=' . var_export($data, true) . "\n";
    $content .= "?>";

    save_to_file($filename, $content);
}

// echo form


Maybe. But you have bigger problems. gettimeofday() can result in incorrect timings if there are processes on your system that change the timer (ie, ntpd). On a "normal" linux, though, I believe the resolution of gettimeofday() is 10us. It can jump forward and backward and time, consequently, based on the processes running on your system. This effectively makes the answer to your question no.

You should look into clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) for timing intervals. It suffers from several less issues due to things like multi-core systems and external clock settings.

Also, look into the clock_getres() function.


  The actual resolution of gettimeofday() depends on the hardware architecture. Intel processors as well as SPARC machines offer high resolution timers that measure microseconds. Other hardware architectures fall back to the systemâ€™s timer, which is typically set to 100 Hz. In such cases, the time resolution will be less accurate. 


I obtained this answer from High Resolution Time Measurement and Timers, Part I
That's true.  serialize() can be pretty useful for that as well.

I think the trick to coming up with a viable system is finding some way to index the data nodes without killing yourself with complexity.

Recently our site has been deluged with the resurgence of the Asprox botnet SQL injection attack. Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the T-SQL commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:

DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--


I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.

I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching SQLÂ Server. The main part I need decoded is:

CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))


I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:

txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));


What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.



Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.

Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));


...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in, since it converted each character into is byte.

I realized that I need to parse each two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:

while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex < 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);


Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the "4C" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.

Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get ",-+" as the result.

How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a "direct cast" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?

I wound up using this. It is a kind of a hack, but it actually works pretty well. The only thing is you have to be very careful with your semicolons. : D

var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);      
var i:Number = 0;
var strSqlSplit:Array = strSql.split(";");
for (i = 0; i < strSqlSplit.length; i++){
    NonQuery(strSqlSplit[i].toString());
}


What is the "purist" or "correct" way to access an object's properties from within an object method that is not a getter/setter method?

I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:

Java:

String property = this.property;


PHP:

$property = $this->property;


or would you do:

Java:

String property = this.getProperty();


PHP:

$property = $this->getProperty();


Forgive me if my Java is a little off, it's been a year since I programmed in Java...

EDIT:

It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...

This may be too basic or limited of a solution, but couldn't you do a String.split() on each line of the file, remembering the result array of the first line to generate the XML, and just spit each line's array data out with the proper XML elements padding each iteration of a loop?

I have a pretty standard table set-up in a current application using the .NET XSD DataSet and TableAdapter features. My contracts table consists of some standard contract information, with a column for the primary department. This column is a foreign key to my Departments table, where I store the basic department name, id, notes. This is all setup and functioning in my SQL Server.

When I use the XSD tool, I can drag both tables in at once and it auto detects/creates the foreign key I have between these two tables. This works great when I'm on my main page and am viewing contract data.

However, when I go to my administrative page to modify the department data. I typically do something like this:

Dim dtDepartment As New DepartmentDataTable()
Dim taDepartment As New DepartmentTableAdapter()

taDepartment.Fill(dtDepartment)


However, at this point an exception is thrown saying to the effect that there is a foreign key reference broken here, I'm guessing since I don't have the Contract DataTable filled. 

How can I fix this problem? I know I can simply remove the foreign key from the XSD to make things work fine, but having the additional integrity check there and having the XSD schema match the SQL schema in the database is nice.


  Am I just going overboard here?


Perhaps ;)

Another approach would be to utilize a private/protected method to actually do the getting (caching/db/etc), and a public wrapper for it that increments the count:

PHP:

public function getName() {    $this->incrementNameCalled();    return $this->_getName();}protected function _getName() {    return $this->name;}

and then from within the object itself:

PHP:

$name = $this->_getName();

This way you can still use that first argument for something else (like sending a flag for whether or not to used cached data here perhaps). 
The funny thing is i wrote a php media gallery for all my music 2 days ago. I had a similar problem.  Im using http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/ for the player. and the playlis are built via php.  all music request go there a script called xfer.php?file=WHATEVER

$filename = base64_url_decode($_REQUEST['file']);
header("Cache-Control: public");
header("Content-Description: File Transfer");
header('Content-disposition: attachment; filename='.basename($filename));
header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
header('Content-Length: '. filesize($filename));

//  Put either file counting code here. either a db or static files

//

readfile($filename);  //and spit the user the file


function base64_url_decode($input) {
    return base64_decode(strtr($input, '-_,', '+/='));
}


And when you call files use something like 

function base64_url_encode($input) {
     return strtr(base64_encode($input), '+/=', '-_,');
}

If you are using some javascript or a flash player (JW player for example) that requires the actual link to be an mp3 file or whatever, you can append the text "&type=.mp3" so the final linke becomes something like "www.example.com/xfer.php?file=34842ffjfjxfh&type=.mp3". That way it looks like it ends with an mp3 extension without affecting the file link.

Well, what is the nature of the flat databases.  Are they large or small.  Is it simple arrays with arrays in them?  if its something simple say userprofiles built as such:

$user = array("name" => "dubayou", 
              "age" => 20,
              "websites" => array("dubayou.com","willwharton.com","codecream.com"),
              "and_one" => "more");


and to save or update the db record for that user.

$dir = "../userdata/";  //make sure to put it bellow what the server can reach.
file_put_contents($dir.$user['name'],serialize($user));


and to load the record for the user

function &get_user($name){
    return unserialize(file_get_contents("../userdata/".$name));
}


but again this implementation will vary on the application and nature of the database you need.

I want to print HTML from a C# web service.  The Web Browser control is overkill, and does not function well in a service environment, nor does it function well on a system with very tight security constraints.  Is there any sort of free .NET library that will support the printing of a basic HTML page?  Here is the code I have so far, which does not run properly.

public void PrintThing(string document)
{
    if (Thread.CurrentThread.GetApartmentState() != ApartmentState.STA)
    {
        Thread thread =
            new Thread((ThreadStart) delegate { PrintDocument(document); });
        thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
        thread.Start();
    }
    else
    {
        PrintDocument(document);
    }
}

protected void PrintDocument(string document)
{
    WebBrowser browser = new WebBrowser();
    browser.DocumentText = document;
    while (browser.ReadyState != WebBrowserReadyState.Complete)
    {
        Application.DoEvents();
    }
    browser.Print();
}


This works fine when called from UI-type threads, but nothing happens when called from a service-type thread.  Changing Print() to ShowPrintPreviewDialog() yields the following IE script error:


  Error: 'dialogArguments.___IE_PrintType' is null or not an object
  URL: res://ieframe.dll/preview.dlg


And a small empty print preview dialog appears.

One of the fun parts of multi-cultural programming is number formats.


Americans use 10,000.50
Germans use 10.000,50
French use 10 000,50


My first approach would be to take the string, parse it backwards, until I encounter a separator and use this as my decimal separator. There is an obvious flaw with that: 10.000 would be interpreted as 10.

Another approach: if the string contains 2 different non-numeric characters, use the last one as the decimal separator and discard the others. If I only have one, check if it occurs more than once and discard it if it does. If it only appears once, check if it has 3 digits after it. If yes, discard it, otherwise use it as decimal separator.

The obvious "best solution" would be to detect the User's culture or Browser, but that does not work if you have a Frenchman using an en-US Windows/Browser.

Does the .net Framework contain some mythical black magic floating point parser that is better than Double.(Try)Parse() in trying to auto-detect the number format?

I've read somewhere the human eye can't distinguish between less than 4 values apart. so This is something to keep in mind. The following algorithm does not compensate for this.

I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:

(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)

//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]colors = []; //holds final colors to be usedrand = new Random();//assumes n is less than 16,777,216randomGen(int n){   while (len(colors) < n){      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color      newRed = rand.next(256);      newGreen = rand.next(256);      newBlue = rand.next(256);      temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];      //only adds new colors to the array      if temp not in colors {         colors.append(temp);      }   }}

One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:

for item in color{   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);   dist = itemSq - tempSq;   dist = abs(dist);}//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.if dist < NUMBER and temp not in colors {   colors.append(temp);}

But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.

Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example.
I don't know the ASP.NET side of the problem but .NET has a pretty powerful class: System.Globalization.CultureInfo. You can use the following code to parse a string containing a double value:

double d = double.Parse("100.20", CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);//  -- OR --double d = double.Parse("100.20", CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture);

If ASP.NET somehow (i.e. using HTTP Request headers) passes current user's CultureInfo to either CultureInfo.CurrentCulture or CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture, these will work fine.
You can't please everyone.  If I enter ten as 10.000, and someone enters ten thousand as 10.000, you cannot handle that without some knowledge of the culture of the input.  Detect the culture somehow (browser, system setting - what is the use case?  ASP?  Internal app, or open to the world?), or provide an example of the expected formatting, and use the most lenient parser you can.  Probably something like:

double d = Double.Parse("5,000.00", NumberStyles.Any, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
I have the following arrays:

$artist = array("the roots", "michael jackson", "billy idol", "more", "and more", "and_YET_MORE");
$count = array(5, 3, 9, 1, 1, 3);


I want to generate a tag cloud that will have artists with a higher number in $count enclosed in h6 tags and the lowest enclosed h1 tags.

From what I've seen, there are a few registry keys that set the default mail client. One of them being:

System Key: [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\mailto\shell\open\command]

Value Name: (Default)

Data Type: REG_SZ (String Value)

Value Data: Mail program command-line. 

I'm not familar with Delphi 7, but I'm sure there are some registry editing libraries in there that you could use to modify this value.

Some places list more than this key, others just this key, so you may need to test a little bit to find the proper one(s).

MySQL has this incredibly useful yet properitary REPLACE INTO SQL Command. 

I wonder: Can this easily be emulated in SQL Server 2005?

Starting a new Transaction, doing a Select() and then either UPDATE or INSERT and COMMIT is always a little bit of a pain, especially when doing it in the application and therefore always keeping 2 versions of the statement.

I wonder if there is an easy and universal way to implement such a function into SQL Server 2005?

The default behaviour is for error_log() to output to the Apache error log.  If this isn't happening check your php.ini settings for the error_log directive - leave it unset to use the Apache log file for the current vhost.
Off the top of my head...

$artist = array("the roots","michael jackson","billy idol","more","and more","and_YET_MORE");$count = array(5,3,9,1,1,3);$highest = max($count);for (int $x = 0; x < count($artist); $x++){    $normalized = $count[$x] / $highest;    $heading = ceil($normalized * 6); // 6 heading types    echo "<h".$heading.">".$artist[$x]."</h".$heading.">";}
I have a little game written in C#. It uses a database as back-end. It's 
a trading card game, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.

What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, ICard, which a card class implements (public class Card056 : ICard) and which contains function that are called by the game.

Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).

Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.

ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();
Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);


The language is C#, but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.

I have been trying to implement Win32's MessageBox using GTK. The app using SDL/OpenGL, so this isn't a GTK app. 

I handle the initialisation (gtk_init) sort of stuff inside the MessageBox function as follows:

int MessageBox(HWND hwnd, const char* text, const char* caption, UINT type)
{
    GtkWidget *window = NULL;
    GtkWidget *dialog = NULL;

    gtk_init(>kArgc, >kArgv);
    window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "delete_event", G_CALLBACK(delete_event), NULL);
    g_signal_connect(G_OBJECT(window), "destroy", G_CALLBACK(destroy), NULL);
    // gcallback calls gtk_main_quit()
    gtk_init_add((GtkFunction)gcallback, NULL);

    if (type & MB_YESNO) {
        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, GTK_MESSAGE_QUESTION, GTK_BUTTONS_YES_NO, text);
    } else {
        dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new(GTK_WINDOW(window), GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT, GTK_MESSAGE_INFO, GTK_BUTTONS_OK, text);
    }

    gtk_window_set_title(GTK_WINDOW(dialog), caption);
    gint result = gtk_dialog_run(GTK_DIALOG(dialog));

    gtk_main();

    gtk_widget_destroy(dialog);

    if (type & MB_YESNO) {
        switch (result) {
        default:
        case GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT:
        case GTK_RESPONSE_NO:
            return IDNO;
            break;
        case GTK_RESPONSE_YES:
            return IDYES;
            break;
        }
    }

    return IDOK;
} 


Now, I am by no means an experienced GTK programmer, and I realise that I'm probably doing something(s) horribly wrong.

However, my problem is that the last dialog popped up with this function stays around until the process exits. Any ideas?

@Ryan

That's correct but it actually makes the tags with the least number, larger.  This code has been tested:

$artist = array("the roots","michael jackson","billy idol","more","and more","and_YET_MORE");$count = array(5,3,9,1,1,3);$highest = max($count);for ($x = 0; $x < count($artist); $x++) {    $normalized =  ($highest - $count[$x]+1) / $highest;    $heading = ceil($normalized * 6); // 6 heading types    echo "<h$heading>{$artist[$x]}</h$heading>";}
